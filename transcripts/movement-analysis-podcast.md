## Introduction

**John**: Welcome back to Ski Mastery Podcast! I'm John, and Alice is here with me once again. Today we're going to talk about something that transforms you from someone who just skis, to someone who can actually diagnose what's happening on the hill.

**Alice**: Oh, this sounds like we're getting into instructor territory!

**John**: We are! Today we're diving into Movement Analysis—or as we call it in the industry, MA. This is the systematic approach to watching a skier and understanding exactly what's working and what needs improvement.

**Alice**: So it's like being a detective, but for skiing?

**John**: Perfect analogy! You're a ski detective. You observe the evidence, you evaluate what's causing the issue, and then you prescribe a solution. In fact, that's our three-step framework: Observe, Evaluate, Prescribe.

**Alice**: That sounds simple enough. But I'm guessing there's a lot more depth to it?

**John**: Oh, there's incredible depth! But the beauty is that once you learn this system, you can watch any skier—including yourself on video—and pinpoint exactly where the breakdown is happening.

**Alice**: I'm ready. Let's crack the code!

## Understanding Turn Phases

**John**: Before we dive into the observation process, we need a common language for describing what happens in a turn. And that starts with understanding that every turn has three distinct phases.

**Alice**: Three phases? I always just thought of a turn as... you know, one continuous thing.

**John**: Most people do! But when you break it down, every turn has an initiation phase, a shaping phase, and a finish phase.

**Alice**: OK, walk me through these.

### Initiation Phase

**John**: The initiation phase is that critical moment when you're transitioning from one turn into the next. Your skis are relatively flat to the snow, you're switching edges, and you're starting to direct the skis into the new direction.

**Alice**: So it's like the launch sequence for a turn.

**John**: Exactly! It's the launch. And this is where a lot of things can go wrong, because if you don't set up the turn correctly at initiation, you'll struggle through the entire rest of the arc.

**Alice**: What does good initiation look like?

**John**: Good initiation is smooth and controlled. You're actively tipping your skis onto the new edges, you're starting to steer with your legs, and you're managing your weight transition from the old outside ski to the new one. It should feel effortless, like the skis are rolling naturally into the turn.

### Shaping Phase

**Alice**: OK, so after initiation, we're into the shaping phase?

**John**: Right. The shaping phase is where you're actively controlling the arc of the turn. Your edges are engaged, you're pressuring the outside ski, and you're steering to create the exact radius you want.

**Alice**: So this is where the turn actually happens—where you're carving that beautiful arc.

**John**: Exactly. And this is where you see the biggest differences between skill levels. A beginner might skid through the shaping phase, while an expert is actively managing edge angle, pressure distribution, and steering to sculpt a precise arc.

**Alice**: So the shaping phase is where the magic happens.

**John**: It's where the artistry happens! This is where you're painting your line on the snow.

### Finish Phase

**Alice**: And then we finish the turn.

**John**: Right. The finish phase is where you're completing the arc and preparing for the next transition. Your skis are coming back across the fall line, and you're starting to release pressure to flatten the skis for the next initiation.

**Alice**: So it's like the landing after a jump—you're setting yourself up for the next movement.

**John**: Perfect! And here's the key: the finish of one turn becomes the setup for the initiation of the next. They're seamlessly connected.

**Alice**: So turns are like links in a chain—each one flows into the next.

**John**: Beautiful way to put it! Now, with this language of turn phases established, we can be really precise when we observe and describe what's happening.

## Step 1: Observe

**John**: Alright, let's dive into the first step of Movement Analysis: Observe. And here's where it gets interesting—we're going to observe two different things simultaneously.

**Alice**: Two things?

**John**: Yes. We're going to observe body performance—what the skier's body is doing. And we're going to observe ski performance—what the skis are doing. Because sometimes the body is doing one thing, but the skis are telling a different story.

**Alice**: So the body and the skis might not match up?

**John**: Exactly! And when they don't match, that mismatch reveals the real issue. Let me show you how to observe each one systematically.

### Observing Body Performance: Pressure Control

**John**: Let's start with observing pressure control. Remember, pressure control has two dimensions—fore-aft and side-to-side.

**Alice**: Right, we talked about this in the fundamentals episode.

**John**: Exactly. So when you're observing fore-aft pressure control, here's what you're looking for: Are the ankle, knee, and hip joints flexing and extending throughout the turn? Or are they locked in one position?

**Alice**: So I'm watching the joints move.

**John**: Right. And here's the next question: Is the skier's spine angled forward, perfectly upright, or leaning back? Because that tells you where their center of mass is relative to their skis.

**Alice**: So if they're leaning back, they're in the backseat.

**John**: Exactly. Now here's a more subtle question: Are the three joints—ankle, knee, hip—flexing proportionately? Or is one joint doing all the work while the others are rigid?

**Alice**: Why does that matter?

**John**: Because if someone is only bending their knees without flexing their ankles or hinging at their hips, they're going to end up aft. Remember, knee flexion alone moves you backward, not forward.

**Alice**: Right, the paradox we talked about!

**John**: Exactly. So you're watching the coordination between all three joints. And finally, you're asking: Does the flexion change throughout the turn, or does the skier stay locked in one position?

**Alice**: So good skiers are constantly adjusting.

**John**: Constantly! They're flexing and extending dynamically. Locked, rigid skiers look stiff and get bounced around.

### Observing Body Performance: Side-to-Side Pressure

**Alice**: OK, so that's fore-aft. What about side-to-side pressure control?

**John**: Great question. Here's what you're looking for: What's the relationship between the two legs? Is one leg much more flexed than the other, or are they bending equally?

**Alice**: And what does that tell me?

**John**: If the inside leg is significantly shorter—more flexed—than the outside leg, that tells me they're successfully transferring weight to the outside ski. But if both legs are equally flexed, they're probably sitting in the middle, and not enough weight is on that outside ski.

**Alice**: So differential leg flexion is the key.

**John**: Exactly. Now, here's the second thing you're watching: Where is the upper body tilting? Is the torso leaning into the turn, or is it creating that counterbalance we talked about—tilting toward the outside ski?

**Alice**: The fighter jet cockpit, staying oriented while the wings bank!

**John**: Perfect! And the final question: Where is the upper body facing? Is it oriented down the hill, or is it rotating with the legs into the turn?

**Alice**: So if the upper body is rotating, that's upper body rotation instead of leg steering.

**John**: Exactly. You're a natural at this!

### Observing Body Performance: Rotational Control

**Alice**: Speaking of rotation, what should I be looking for with rotational control?

**John**: Here's the key question: Is the upper body rotating before the lower body? Or is the upper body stable while the legs actively rotate underneath?

**Alice**: So it's about the sequence—what moves first.

**John**: Exactly. If the shoulders and torso wind up and then unload into the turn, that's upper body rotation—the legs are just following passively. But if the upper body stays quiet and the legs initiate the steering, that's active leg rotation.

**Alice**: And that's what we want.

**John**: That's what we want! Now, the second thing you're watching: How much does the body rotate, and where exactly does that rotation occur during the turn?

**Alice**: So is it happening at initiation? During shaping? At the finish?

**John**: Exactly. And here's the final question: Do both legs turn the same amount, at the same time, in the same direction?

**Alice**: Wait, they might not?

**John**: Well, ideally they do. But sometimes you'll see a skier where the inside ski is pivoting independently or at a different rate. That's a loss of coordination—usually caused by upper body rotation throwing things out of sync.

### Observing Body Performance: Edge Control

**Alice**: OK, last one—edge control. What am I watching for?

**John**: First question: What parts of the body are tipping? Are the feet tipping? The knees? The whole body from the feet up? Or is just the upper body folding sideways?

**Alice**: And we want the tipping to start from the feet, right?

**John**: Exactly! Tipping should originate from the feet and flow upward. Next question: What part or parts of the body are creating angulation? Is there an angle at the knees? At the hips?

**Alice**: And how much angulation are they creating?

**John**: Exactly. And here's a critical one: What's the combination of inclination versus angulation? Is the skier leaning their whole body into the turn with no separation between upper and lower body? Or are they creating those angles—legs tipping more than the torso?

**Alice**: So too much inclination and not enough angulation would be a problem.

**John**: Exactly. And the final question: Do both legs tip the same amount, at the same time, in the same direction?

**Alice**: Same as with rotation—we want symmetry and coordination.

**John**: Perfect! Now, that's observing body performance. But remember, we also need to observe ski performance.

### Observing Ski Performance: Pressure Control

**Alice**: OK, so now we're watching the skis themselves, not the body. What am I looking for?

**John**: Let's start with pressure control. First question: Where along the ski is the pressure? Is it on the tip, the middle, or the tail? And does that change throughout the turn?

**Alice**: So I'm literally watching where the ski is flexing or bending.

**John**: Exactly! A ski that's flexing evenly along its full length means good pressure distribution. A ski that's only flexing at the tail means the skier is in the backseat.

**Alice**: And what about pressure between the two skis?

**John**: Great question. Does one ski have significantly more pressure than the other? Or are they weighted about equally? And here's the tell-tale sign of a problem: Does one ski ever lift completely off the snow?

**Alice**: And lifting a ski is bad?

**John**: Well, it depends on context. But if the inside ski is floating in the air during the shaping phase, that usually means they've collapsed onto the inside ski instead of balancing on the outside one. It's a loss of control.

### Observing Ski Performance: Rotational Control

**Alice**: What about rotation? How do I see rotation in the skis?

**John**: Here's what you're looking for: What shape are the skis tracking? Are they making a C-shape—a smooth, symmetrical arc? A J-shape—where the turn starts gradually and then suddenly sharpens? Or a Z-shape—where the skis pivot abruptly?

**Alice**: And C-shape is ideal?

**John**: C-shape is the smoothest and most controlled. J-shape or Z-shape usually indicates some kind of steering issue—either delayed rotation or abrupt upper body rotation.

**Alice**: What else am I watching?

**John**: Is one ski turning at a faster rate than the other? Or are both skis carving the same arc simultaneously?

**Alice**: And we want both skis together.

**John**: Ideally, yes! If one ski is turning before the other, that's usually the inside ski initiating early—a sign of upper body rotation.

### Observing Ski Performance: Edge Control

**Alice**: And finally, edge control. What do I observe in the skis?

**John**: First: How much are the skis edging? Are they high on edge, creating a sharp angle with the snow? Or are they relatively flat?

**Alice**: And that changes based on the type of turn, right?

**John**: Exactly. Gentle turns on easy terrain might have lower edge angles, while aggressive carved turns need higher angles. The question is: Is the amount of edge angle appropriate for what the skier is trying to do?

**Alice**: And what else?

**John**: Is the edge angle changing throughout the turn, or staying constant? Good skiing usually involves progressively increasing edge angle through the shaping phase.

**Alice**: So it's dynamic, not static.

**John**: Exactly. And finally: Is one ski edging more than the other? And does one ski tip onto the new edge before the other?

**Alice**: And what would that tell me?

**John**: If the inside ski tips onto the new edge way before the outside ski, that's usually a sign they're dropping their inside shoulder into the turn instead of tipping from the feet. It's improper initiation.

---

## Step 2: Evaluate

**John**: Alright, so we've observed body performance and ski performance. Now comes step two: Evaluate. This is where you take all those observations and figure out what's actually causing the issue.

**Alice**: So we're connecting the dots.

**John**: Exactly! And here's the critical skill: distinguishing between cause and effect.

**Alice**: What do you mean?

### Cause vs. Effect

**John**: Let's say you observe a skier whose skis are skidding through every turn—they're not carving clean arcs. That's the effect. But what's the cause?

**Alice**: Maybe they're not edging enough?

**John**: That's getting warmer, but "not edging enough" is still kind of an effect. The real question is: Why aren't they edging? Where does the movement originate?

**Alice**: So I need to trace it back to the body.

**John**: Exactly! Maybe the cause is that they're not tipping their feet inside the boots. Or maybe they're leaning their upper body into the turn instead of tipping from the feet up. Or maybe they're sitting back, so they can't engage the shovel of the ski to create the carving effect.

**Alice**: So the skis are just showing me the symptom. The body is where the real problem lives.

**John**: Exactly! The skis are the output. The body movements are the input. And as evaluators, we need to trace the output back to the input.

### The DIRT Framework

**Alice**: OK, so how do we actually do this evaluation systematically?

**John**: This is where the DIRT framework comes in. DIRT stands for Duration, Intensity, Rate, and Timing. It's basically a lens that helps us quantify and qualify what we're seeing—it makes our observations precise instead of vague.

**Alice**: DIRT. I like it—catchy acronym!

**John**: Right? And here's the beauty: you don't have to use all four elements every time. But being aware of them transforms how you describe skiing. Let me break down each one.

**Alice**: Hit me.

**John**: First: Duration. This is the length of time a movement occurs. For example, a skier might extend their legs throughout the entire first half of the turn, or they might shorten that extension so it only happens during initiation.

**Alice**: So it's about how long the movement lasts—whether it's continuous or brief.

**John**: Exactly! Second: Intensity. This is the amount of power or magnitude behind a movement. Think about the difference between a gentle ankle flex versus a powerful hop in the air—same movement category, completely different intensity.

**Alice**: So it's how much force or energy goes into it.

**John**: Right! Third: Rate. This is the speed at which the movement happens. Edge movements in short-radius turns happen at a much faster rate than in long, sweeping GS turns.

**Alice**: So it's about quickness—gradual versus sudden.

**John**: Perfect! And fourth: Timing. This is when the movement occurs within the turn. Does the skier start edging right at initiation? Or do they delay it until the shaping phase?

**Alice**: So it's about sequencing—what happens when.

**John**: Exactly! Now let me show you why DIRT matters. Compare these two descriptions. First version: "The skier turned their upper body to turn the skis."

**Alice**: OK, that's pretty basic.

**John**: Now listen to this version: "The skier rotated their upper body quickly and powerfully to initiate the turn before their legs started steering the skis."

**Alice**: Whoa, that paints a completely different picture!

**John**: Right? The first version is vague. The second version uses Rate—"quickly"—Intensity—"powerfully"—and Timing—"before their legs started steering"—to create a vivid, precise description of what's actually happening.

**Alice**: So DIRT makes your observations come alive.

**John**: Exactly! Here's another example. First version: "The skier straightened their outside leg to pressure the ski."

**Alice**: Again, pretty basic.

**John**: Now with DIRT: "The skier smoothly and continuously extended their outside leg through the entire shaping phase to maintain steady pressure on the outside ski."

**Alice**: OK, now I can actually visualize the movement—I know it's smooth, continuous, and happening during shaping.

**John**: Exactly! That's the power of DIRT. It transforms vague observations into actionable, specific insights.

### DIRT in Action: Real Examples

**Alice**: OK, give me some concrete examples of how I'd use each element.

**John**: Let's start with Duration. Imagine you observe a skier who's flexing their ankles nicely at the start of the turn, but then losing that flex halfway through.

**Alice**: So the duration is too short.

**John**: Exactly! The movement is correct, but it's not sustained. You'd evaluate: "Good ankle flexion, but insufficient duration—it's only lasting through initiation instead of being maintained through shaping and finish."

**Alice**: Got it. What about Intensity?

**John**: Intensity example: A skier is trying to hop their skis off the snow to initiate turns, but they're barely leaving the ground. You'd evaluate: "The movement pattern is correct—they're extending to unweight—but the intensity is insufficient. They need more power in that extension to actually get airborne."

**Alice**: Or conversely, too much intensity would be like launching yourself into orbit when you only need a gentle unweighting.

**John**: Perfect! Now Rate: Imagine a skier who's making smooth, round turns but they're struggling in moguls. You observe that their edge movements are happening at the same gradual rate they use on groomers.

**Alice**: But moguls need faster movements!

**John**: Exactly! You'd evaluate: "The movements are correct, but the rate is too slow for the terrain. They need to increase the speed of their edge transitions to match the quick rhythm of the bumps."

**Alice**: And Timing?

**John**: Classic timing issue: A skier starts rotating their upper body at the very beginning of initiation—before their legs have even released the old edges.

**Alice**: So they're throwing their shoulders downhill first.

**John**: Exactly! You'd evaluate: "The upper body rotation is happening too early in the sequence. Ideally, the legs should release and start steering first, with the upper body remaining stable. The timing is causing the outside ski to turn before the inside ski."

**Alice**: So timing is all about the sequence and when things happen relative to each other.

**John**: Perfect! And here's the key: often, the same skier will have issues with multiple DIRT elements. Maybe their movement has insufficient intensity AND incorrect timing. DIRT helps you tease apart the different layers of the problem.

### Comparing to the Ideal

**Alice**: OK, so I've identified the problem using DIRT. What's next?

**John**: Now you compare what you observed to what the ideal performance should be. This is where your knowledge of the fundamentals comes in.

**Alice**: So I'm asking: What should this look like if it were done correctly?

**John**: Exactly. Let's stick with our extension example. Ideal performance would be: the skier compresses progressively through the shaping phase to absorb pressure, and then extends smoothly at the finish phase to release and transition.

**Alice**: So I've compared current state to ideal state, and I've identified the gap.

**John**: Perfect! And that gap is what we're going to fix with step three.

---

## Step 3: Prescribe

**John**: Alright, final step: Prescribe. This is where you take your evaluation and translate it into actionable feedback that creates change.

**Alice**: So I'm writing the prescription, like a doctor.

**John**: Exactly! But here's the critical part: you don't try to fix everything at once. You isolate one skill, in one turn phase, and you prescribe change using—you guessed it—DIRT.

**Alice**: So I'm using DIRT both to evaluate and to prescribe?

**John**: Exactly! DIRT is the common language for both diagnosis and treatment.

### Prescribing with DIRT

**Alice**: OK, walk me through an example.

**John**: Let's stick with our skier who's extending too early. Here's how I'd prescribe change using DIRT.

First, I'd address Timing: "I want you to delay your leg extension until you've completed the arc and you're transitioning into the next turn."

**Alice**: So you're telling them when to do the movement.

**John**: Exactly. Next, I might address Duration: "Sustain your compression through the entire shaping phase—from initiation all the way through the fall line."

**Alice**: So how long to maintain it.

**John**: Right. Then I might address Rate: "Make your extension smooth and gradual, not abrupt. Think of it as a slow, controlled release."

**Alice**: So how fast to do it.

**John**: And finally, I might address Intensity: "You only need to extend about halfway—just enough to flatten the skis. Don't stand fully upright."

**Alice**: So how much to do.

**John**: Exactly! And notice what I didn't do—I didn't overwhelm them with ten different corrections. I isolated one movement, in one phase, and gave them precise, actionable guidance using DIRT.

### Understanding Cause and Effect Relationships

**Alice**: So DIRT helps me describe what I see. But how do I connect body movements to ski performance? That's the "why," right?

**John**: Exactly! This is where cause and effect relationships come in. The body movements are the cause. The ski performance is the effect. And your job is to trace the connection between them.

**Alice**: So I'm asking: "This ski behavior is happening because that body movement is happening."

**John**: Perfect! Let me give you four classic cause-and-effect relationships you'll see constantly.

### Cause-Effect Relationship 1: The Backseat Skier

**John**: First relationship: A skier is pressuring the tails of their skis during the shaping phase—you can see the tails flexing way more than the tips. That's the effect. What's the cause?

**Alice**: They're in the backseat!

**John**: Right, but let's be more specific using our joint knowledge. The cause is: their ankles aren't flexed enough, and their knees are bent too much. This combination positions their center of mass over the tail of the ski.

**Alice**: So insufficient ankle flexion plus excessive knee flexion equals backseat stance.

**John**: Exactly! And it looks like the skier is constantly losing their balance backward, struggling to recover.

### Cause-Effect Relationship 2: The Inside Ski Problem

**Alice**: What's the second relationship?

**John**: Second: A skier's inside ski has more pressure than the outside ski during the finish phase. That's the effect—you can see the inside ski carving a tighter arc while the outside ski is lighter.

**Alice**: So what's causing that?

**John**: The cause: their knees and hips are flexed very similarly to each other—no differential leg flexion—and their torso is leaning into the turn instead of creating angulation.

**Alice**: So equal leg flexion plus inside-leaning torso equals pressure on the wrong ski!

**John**: Exactly. They're collapsing inward instead of balancing on the outside ski.

### Cause-Effect Relationship 3: The Upper Body Rotation

**Alice**: Third relationship?

**John**: Third: The outside ski turns first and faster than the inside ski during initiation, and overall the skier hasn't really started turning yet. The skis are diverging instead of parallel. That's the effect.

**Alice**: And the cause?

**John**: The skier rotated their torso and pelvis into the turn before their legs started steering. The upper body initiated the movement, and the legs are just passively following.

**Alice**: So upper body rotation is causing that weird diverging ski pattern.

**John**: Exactly! The timing is wrong—upper body moves before legs—and it creates this ineffective, uncoordinated turn entry.

### Cause-Effect Relationship 4: The Flat-Footed Pusher

**John**: Fourth relationship: During initiation, the outside ski gets pushed away from the body and edges, while the inside ski remains on the old edge and doesn't release. The skier hasn't really started turning yet. That's the effect.

**Alice**: What's the cause?

**John**: The skier leaned their upper body to the inside of the turn—creating inclination—but they pushed the outside leg away from their body instead of tipping both feet together.

**Alice**: So they created inclination but no angulation, and they're using the wrong movement to try to edge?

**John**: Exactly! They're trying to create edge angle by pushing the ski away rather than tipping their feet and creating angles at the joints. It's a completely ineffective movement pattern.

**Alice**: These are so specific! I can actually picture each scenario.

**John**: That's the point! When you understand these common cause-and-effect relationships, you can diagnose what you're seeing instantly. The ski performance tells the story, and you trace it back to the body movements.

### Fixing Cause and Effect Relationships

**Alice**: So once I've identified the cause-and-effect relationship, I prescribe a change to the cause, which should improve the effect.

**John**: Exactly! And here's the final piece: after they make the change, you observe again to see if the ski performance—the effect—has actually improved.

**Alice**: So it's a feedback loop. Observe, evaluate, prescribe, then observe again.

**John**: Perfect! Let's say you identified Relationship #1—the backseat skier. You prescribe: "Flex your ankles more—push your shins gently but continuously into the boot tongue—and reduce how much you're bending your knees." You watch them ski again, and now you observe that pressure is distributed along the entire length of the ski instead of just the tail.

**Alice**: So the ski performance improved because the body movement improved!

**John**: Exactly. The cause-and-effect relationship is now more ideal. The skier has better ankle and knee coordination, which creates centered pressure distribution and cleaner arc initiation.

**Alice**: That's so satisfying!

**John**: It really is! That moment when you see the change happen—when the skier suddenly feels the grip, hears the clean edge, and sees the round arc—that's the magic of Movement Analysis.

### Prescriptions for Different Scenarios

**Alice**: OK, so I understand the framework. But can you give me some specific prescriptions for common problems?

**John**: Absolutely! Let me walk you through prescriptions for our backseat skier across all three turn phases. This'll show you how to prescribe phase-specific changes.

**Alice**: Perfect—I love concrete examples.

**John**: So let's say you've diagnosed that the skier is pressuring the tails throughout the turn because of insufficient ankle flexion and a backward-leaning spine. Here's how you'd prescribe change for each phase.

### Prescription: Fore-Aft Pressure

**John**: For the initiation phase, you'd say: "To shift pressure from the tails toward the center of your skis, I want you to flex your ankles and hinge slightly at your hips. Imagine your shins and your spine are two parallel lines, both angled forward. This will help the entire ski engage with the snow right from the start of the turn, creating a rounder arc."

**Alice**: So you're giving them the specific joints to move and a visual cue about parallel lines.

**John**: Exactly! For the shaping phase: "Maintain that forward flexion in your ankles and hips as you carve through the middle of the turn. Keep your shins and spine angled forward and parallel. This keeps pressure centered on the ski while you're heading downhill, which lets the entire length of the ski stay engaged and shape the arc."

**Alice**: So it's about sustaining what they started in initiation.

**John**: Right—that's the Duration element! And for the finish phase: "Continue increasing your ankle and hip flexion as you complete the turn—maybe even add a bit more than you had during shaping. Keep those shins and spine parallel and forward. This allows the whole ski to engage through the finish, creating a round, controlled arc that regulates your speed instead of requiring you to skid."

**Alice**: So they're progressively adding more flexion as the turn develops.

**John**: Exactly! That's managing Duration and Intensity across all three phases.

### Prescription: Ski-to-Ski Pressure

**Alice**: What about someone who's not getting enough pressure on the outside ski?

**John**: Great question. Let's say you diagnosed Relationship #2—equal leg flexion and inside-leaning torso causing inside ski pressure. Here's your phase-by-phase prescription.

**Alice**: I'm listening.

**John**: Initiation phase: "To direct more pressure to your outside ski, I want you to tilt your upper body slightly so your pelvis and shoulders stay parallel to the slope—not leaning into the turn. As you make that adjustment, flex your inside knee and hip while gently extending your outside leg."

**Alice**: So they're creating that differential leg action right from the start.

**John**: Exactly! Shaping phase: "Continue adjusting your upper body alignment so your pelvis and shoulders remain parallel to the slope throughout the middle of the turn. Keep flexing your inside leg more than your outside leg. This maintains that counterbalance and keeps pressure on the outside ski."

**Alice**: So they're sustaining that alignment through the meat of the turn.

**John**: Right! And finish phase: "Keep that alignment going all the way through the completion of the turn. Your pelvis and shoulders should still be parallel to the slope, and your inside leg should remain shorter than your outside leg. This ensures consistent pressure on the outside ski from start to finish."

**Alice**: So the same movement pattern, just sustained across all three phases.

**John**: Exactly—you're seeing the pattern! It's about establishing the correct movement early and maintaining it throughout.

### Prescription: Rotational Control

**Alice**: What about our upper body rotation problem—Relationship #3?

**John**: OK, so we diagnosed that the torso and pelvis are rotating before the legs, causing the outside ski to turn first. Here's the prescription.

**Alice**: Hit me.

**John**: Initiation phase: "To get both skis turning together in the same direction, I want you to turn your legs underneath a stable upper body. Before you start the turn, get your upper body oriented toward where the turn will finish—facing the apex. Then let your legs rotate underneath that stable frame. This creates a rounder turn shape right from the beginning."

**Alice**: So upper body quiet and pre-oriented, legs do the steering.

**John**: Perfect! Shaping phase: "Continue rotating both legs in the direction of the turn while keeping your upper body separated—facing more downhill than your legs. This separation lets you control the rate of rotation, which controls the radius of your turn. The more you turn your legs, the tighter the arc."

**Alice**: So they're actively managing the steering throughout shaping.

**John**: Exactly! And finish phase: "Maintain that upper-lower body separation all the way through the finish. Your legs will have turned more than your upper body, which should already be facing toward the apex of the next turn. This lets you complete the arc precisely and sets you up perfectly for the next initiation."

**Alice**: So the upper body is already anticipating the next turn while the legs finish the current one.

**John**: Exactly! That's advanced separation—it's what makes expert skiing look so fluid.

### Prescription: Edge Control

**Alice**: Last one—edge control. What would you prescribe?

**John**: Let's say you diagnosed Relationship #4—the flat-footed pusher who's creating inclination without angulation. Here's the prescription.

**Alice**: Go for it.

**John**: Initiation phase: "To create a rounder turn shape, tip both feet and legs in the direction of the turn while keeping your pelvis and shoulders parallel to the slope. This lets your inside ski release from the old turn and allows your outside ski to engage cleanly on the new edge."

**Alice**: So tipping from the feet, not leaning from the torso.

**John**: Exactly! Shaping phase: "Keep tipping your legs in the direction of the turn while maintaining that pelvis-and-shoulders alignment to the slope. This combination—tipping legs plus angulation—lets you fine-tune the edge angle throughout the turn, which controls the shape and radius."

**Alice**: So they're dynamically adjusting edge angle through the arc.

**John**: Right! And finish phase: "Continue tipping your legs and maintaining your upper body alignment all the way through the turn completion. This sustained edge angle gives you a controlled arc and sets up a clean edge release for the next turn."

**Alice**: So edge control is really about that coordination between tipping the legs and maintaining upper body alignment.

**John**: Exactly! And notice the pattern across all these prescriptions: we're giving specific body movements, we're specifying which phase, and we're explaining what ski performance will result. That's complete, actionable prescription using DIRT.

**Alice**: This is so practical! I can actually use these templates.

**John**: That's the idea! Once you understand these common prescriptions, you can adapt them to any skier you're analyzing.

## Putting It All Together: A Real Example

**John**: Alright, let's walk through a complete Movement Analysis from start to finish with a realistic scenario.

**Alice**: I'm ready. Give me a student!

**John**: OK, here's your student: an intermediate skier on a blue groomed run, making medium-radius turns. You're watching from below.

### Observe

**John**: Step one: Observe. What do you see in their body performance?

**Alice**: Alright, I'm watching. I notice their upper body is rotating—shoulders are swinging into each turn. Their outside leg is pretty straight, while their inside leg is bending a lot. And their spine is leaning back—they look like they're sitting in a chair.

**John**: Perfect observations! Now, what do you see in their ski performance?

**Alice**: The skis are making a Z-shape—they pivot abruptly at the start of each turn. And I can hear them skidding loudly through the shaping phase. Oh, and the inside ski lifts off the snow partway through the turn.

**John**: Excellent! You've observed both body and ski performance. Now, step two.

### Evaluate

**Alice**: OK, evaluating. Let me use DIRT to analyze what I'm seeing.

**John**: Go for it.

**Alice**: The upper body rotation is happening too early—that's a timing issue. It's also happening too abruptly—that's a rate issue. The rotation is coming from the upper body instead of the legs—that's the cause.

**John**: Perfect! What about the fore-aft issue?

**Alice**: They're aft throughout the entire turn—that's a duration issue. They never move their center of mass forward. And the intensity is too much—they're way too far back, not just slightly aft.

**John**: Great! Now compare to ideal. What should be happening instead?

**Alice**: Ideally, they should be steering with leg rotation while keeping the upper body quiet. And they should have their center of mass forward over the middle of the ski, with flexed ankles and a hinge at the hips.

**John**: Perfect! Now you've identified the gap. Let's prescribe.

### Prescribe

**Alice**: OK, but there are two big issues—rotation and fore-aft balance. Do I try to fix both?

**John**: Great question! And the answer is: no. Pick one. Which one do you think is more fundamental?

**Alice**: I think the fore-aft balance. Because if they're in the backseat, they can't engage the front of the ski, which means even if they fix their rotation, they still won't be able to carve.

**John**: Brilliant reasoning! So you're going to prescribe a change to fore-aft pressure control. How would you do it using DIRT?

**Alice**: Alright, here's my prescription: "I want you to flex your ankles—push your shins gently into the front of your boots—and maintain that flex throughout the entire turn." That's addressing duration and giving them the specific movement.

**John**: Excellent! What else?

**Alice**: "Start this ankle flex at the very beginning of the turn, during initiation, and sustain it all the way through the finish." That's timing.

**John**: Perfect! And intensity?

**Alice**: "You don't need a lot—just a gentle, constant pressure into the boot tongue, like you're pressing a button with your shin."

**John**: Beautiful! That's a complete prescription using DIRT. You've isolated one skill—fore-aft pressure control—in one phase—actually, throughout all phases—and given clear, actionable guidance. Now what?

**Alice**: Now I observe again to see if the ski performance improves!

**John**: Exactly. And let's say you watch them make a few more turns, and now you notice the skis are flexing more evenly along their length. The Z-shape is less abrupt—it's becoming more of a C-shape. And they're skidding less.

**Alice**: So the cause-and-effect relationship is improving!

**John**: Exactly! The body movement changed—they moved their center of mass forward with ankle flex—and the ski performance changed as a result. That's successful Movement Analysis.

## Common Pitfalls in Movement Analysis

**John**: Alright, before we wrap up, let's talk about common pitfalls—mistakes that people make when they're learning Movement Analysis.

**Alice**: Oh, I like this. What should I avoid?

### Pitfall 1: Observing Too Much at Once

**John**: Pitfall number one: trying to observe everything at once. Beginners will watch a skier and try to see body performance and ski performance and all four skills simultaneously, and they end up seeing nothing clearly.

**Alice**: So how do I avoid that?

**John**: Pick one thing to observe per run. Watch them once and only focus on fore-aft pressure control. Watch them again and only focus on rotational control. Build your observations one layer at a time.

**Alice**: So multiple observations, each with a narrow focus.

**John**: Exactly! You're building a complete picture, one layer at a time, like a painter.

### Pitfall 2: Confusing Cause and Effect

**John**: Pitfall number two: confusing cause and effect. People will say, "The skier needs to get more edge angle." But that's describing the effect—the ski performance. The real question is: what body movement will create that edge angle?

**Alice**: So I need to trace it back to the body.

**John**: Exactly. Don't prescribe outcomes—prescribe movements. Instead of "get more edge angle," say "tip your feet more inside your boots and push your hip laterally into the hill."

**Alice**: So specific body movements, not vague outcomes.

**John**: Perfect!

### Pitfall 3: Overloading the Prescription

**John**: Pitfall number three: overloading the prescription. People observe five different issues and then try to fix all of them in one lesson.

**Alice**: And that's overwhelming.

**John**: Completely! Remember: one skill, one turn phase. Fix that, observe the result, and then move to the next issue if needed.

**Alice**: So it's incremental improvement, not a total overhaul.

**John**: Exactly. Skiing is a coordination sport. You can't rebuild everything at once. You make small, precise adjustments that create ripple effects.

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Turn Phases

**John**: And pitfall number four: ignoring turn phases. People will say, "You need to flex more." But when? At what phase?

**Alice**: So the prescription needs to specify the phase.

**John**: Exactly! "Flex more during the shaping phase to absorb pressure" is way more actionable than just "flex more."

**Alice**: Because timing is part of DIRT!

**John**: Exactly. Always specify when the movement should happen.

## Closing Thoughts

**John**: Alright Alice, let's bring it home. We've covered the complete Movement Analysis process: Observe, Evaluate, Prescribe.

**Alice**: Observe body performance and ski performance. Evaluate using DIRT to identify cause and effect. Prescribe changes to body movement using DIRT.

**John**: Perfect summary! And here's the beautiful thing: this isn't just for instructors. You can use this framework to analyze your own skiing, especially if you record video of yourself.

**Alice**: Oh, that's a great point. I could film myself and then go through this process.

**John**: Exactly! Watch the video, observe what your body and skis are doing, evaluate where the breakdown is happening, and then prescribe a specific change for your next run.

**Alice**: So it's self-coaching!

**John**: It's absolutely self-coaching. And it takes the mystery out of improvement. Instead of hoping for random breakthroughs, you're systematically identifying and fixing specific issues.

**Alice**: I love that—systematic improvement.

**John**: Alright, here's my challenge for you: Next time you're on the mountain, pick one skill—maybe it's edge control—and observe just that one thing on your next run. Not your whole skiing, just edge control. What are your feet doing? What are your skis doing? Then evaluate: what could be better? And prescribe one small change using DIRT.

**Alice**: One skill, one observation, one change.

**John**: Perfect! That's the power of Movement Analysis. It turns skiing from a black box into a transparent, improvable system.

**Alice**: And remember—you're not guessing anymore. You're diagnosing.

**John**: Beautifully said! Alright everyone, we hope this framework helps you become your own ski detective. Whether you're coaching others or coaching yourself, Observe-Evaluate-Prescribe is your roadmap to breakthrough improvement.

**Alice**: Until next time, keep analyzing!

**John**: Happy skiing!
