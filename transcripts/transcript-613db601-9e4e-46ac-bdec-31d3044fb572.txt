Speaker 2: Welcome back to the deep dive today we are straping in in heading straight for the Fall line。Oh yeah，because we are diving deep and I mean really deep into the absolute mechanics of our bines kink we've got a massive stacks resources from you the listener and they detail not just would great skills do but the intricate physics behind why a ski even performs the way it does。 

Speaker 3: That's right。if you ever been on a lesson and founders of asking，but wait，why does tipping my need and word make my ski turn？ 

Speaker 2: This is the deep dies you been waiting for。 

Speaker 3: I have absolutely been that person。 

Speaker 2: We all have the source material we're working with today is well，essentially the blueprint of high performance movement on snow it's all about transforming，what feels like a complex physic seclation into into human korea's。 

Speaker 3: Like that，so we are mentioned today's to take those dense mechanical explanations you know，things like their relationship between the center of mass in the base of support or the difference between inclination and angelation and turn them into something with it。 Something you can feel on the mountain exactly we want you to feel the why the next time you hit the slops it gives you this immediate actionable technical vocabulary。 

Speaker 2: So you're not just miming in instructor you're understanding the course in the fact。 

Speaker 3: That's the goal and fundamentally you know achieveing that kind of skin mastery it really comes down to skillfully managing three call called skill concepts。 These concepts are the bedrock the pillars that support all performance and it doesn't matter if you making short AC，turnes or you know long beautiful arcstrepowder。 

Speaker 2: And those three pillars，which I think we should。dedicate this entire deep dive to are Lately about first it's pressure control that's all about managing the force is the snow is exerting back on you second rotational control，which is about where you skies are pointed and how fast they get there。 

Speaker 3: Right the stiring。 

Speaker 2: And third edging control，which is that？ That critical geometry of how you tip the skies onto their edge。taxly cut into the snow。 

Speaker 3: And to manage those three big concepts and to get with the source are coming ideal ski performance we rely on a very specific operational blueprint this blueprint is made up of what we call the five fundamentals。 These are the specific repeatable movements the actual actions you take with your body that connect those abstract skills to the physical world to the snow。 

Speaker 2: Let's impact that blueprint immediately because that sounds like a lot of information to absorb right off the bed。so what are these five fundamentals that defined every single movement we make on skies。 

Speaker 3: They're very specific so No.1 controlling their relationship between your center of mass or CM and your base of support。the BOS that's your foreign F pressure。 

Speaker 2: Got it from to back？ 

Speaker 3: Second。 Directing pressure from one ski to the other and specificly making sure the vast majority of that false lands on your outside ski OK third precisely controlling the angle of your edges on the snow using two tools called inclination and angelation。 

Speaker 2: We'll get in that distinction for sure。 

Speaker 3: Oh，we will false fundamental is stearing the skies using active late rotation and this is the key part separate from your upper body。 

Speaker 2: The classic mistake。 

Speaker 3: Exactly。and then finally，the fifth fundamental。 Regulating the magnitude of the forcees the share intensity of the pressure you create throughout the term。 

Speaker 2: Wow。so we just describe five incredible complex movements in what ten second，this sounds like a doctoral thesis we need detector。 

Speaker 3: Right now。 

Speaker 2: These five actions are the Foundation so let's start with The One that dictates the very existent of a turn pressure control。 This is the skill of managing that force the snow pushes back with because that push。that is what physically drives the arc of the turn。 

Speaker 3: You've got it pressure control isn't just you know lean hiring there it's about anticipating and reacting to the share magnitude of the force。 

Speaker 2: Right，because when you're just standing still，the force is just your body way，right？that stead，it exactly。 

Speaker 3: Yeah，but the moment you start bending that ski into a curve，a speciali at speed the snow pushes back with force that can and often do exceed twice your body weight twice so control。 The magnitude and just as importantly the distribution of that dynamic force that's the gateway to high performance skin。 

Speaker 2: OK so let's focus first on that first fundamental the four F pressure game this relationship CM over BOS it's where your weight your center of mass is position relative to the links of your skin which is your basic of support the sound so academic but on the Hill it's the difference between caraving a beautiful smooth turn and。 Well，skating on controllablely。 

Speaker 3: It's absolutely crucial because minipulating that relationship is what controls how the ski flex is and ski flex is everything。 

Speaker 2: Why so important？ 

Speaker 3: We'll think about the shape of a ski is got that our glass shape the side cut when a ski is properly flexed when it's pressure correctly along its in tirelank that side cut fully engages with the snow and that side cut is what dictates the clean predictable shape of your arc。 

Speaker 2: So you're basically using the tool as was designed。 

Speaker 3: You are if you're the ski're right under your。 Food the whole structure works。but if your CM slips back even a little，you lose the tip，the ski flat and out the side cut disengages and the turning radius it effectively disappears。 

Speaker 2: And that's a skid that。 

Speaker 3: Is a skid。 

Speaker 2: And I think a lot of intermeded skills myself，included for a long time。 Think of this is just leaning forward or leaning backward，but our source is are so specific this isn't a gross body movement。 

Speaker 3: Not at all we're talking about process joint articulation micro adjustments there are three main adjustments here the ankle，the knee and the hip。okay？ 

Speaker 2: Let's break in down let's start with The One closer to the snow the。 

Speaker 3: Ankle the ankle is your fine tuner it's the joint closes to the ski so it's your most subtle and process lever。 When you increase your anklefaction when you gently，push your shines in the front of your boot town。your CM moves forward relative to your feet。 

Speaker 2: And the pressure goes to the shuffle of the skin。 

Speaker 3: Instantly Conversely if you reduce that anklefaction，you know straightening ankle little the pressure Suddenly moves back to or the tail。this is your primary tool for micro managing，the engagement of the skin tip。 

Speaker 2: So if you looking for just a quick sharp book into the very beginning of a turn。 A fraction of an inch of anchor flection can make all the difference。 

Speaker 3: That's it。 

Speaker 2: OK，so what about the next joined up the knee？how does that interact with the anchor？ 

Speaker 3: The knee is it's an interesting one because it works in a way inversely to the anchor's influence on your CM。 

Speaker 2: What do you mean inversely？ 

Speaker 3: When you Benjamin when you increase neifaction your center of manners actually drops down and back relative to the skin。 So pressure shifts after the tale。 

Speaker 2: Wait，hold on。so a beginner trying to get forward pressure someone just tell them benjanies are actually sending their weight backward。 

Speaker 3: That's the paradox if a scare tries to get forward just by bending learning is deeply without a corresponding ankle flex and a forward hepenge they end up sitting back。 

Speaker 2: In the backseat。 

Speaker 3: Every time now，if you extend the knee pushing upward and slately forward。 The pressure ships，forward see，you can think of the knee as the main controller for the dynamic release and engagement of the tail session，especially during the turn transition。 

Speaker 2: This is why just saying bend your needs is Maybe the worth to advice in skin if it is not。 

Speaker 3: Qualified it's one of the most misunderstood cues for sure which of course leads us to the hip。the hip is the big engine that that's your overall stans the hip。 

Speaker 2: Trying to like a powerful henge，then it dicted to the overall Lin of your torso。 

Speaker 3: Correct。 When you hinge forward at the hips and we're talking about a movement like taking a slay controlled Bo keeping a flat back you move your CM significantly forward over the linked of the ski。 

Speaker 2: Driving major pressure onto the。 

Speaker 3: Tip，right？if you extended the hip，what people off to call standing up。you move your CM back toward，the center，or even the tail。this extension is absolutely essential for managing。the pressure release of the end of the turn it allows the ski to flat now and transition smoothly into the next one。 

Speaker 2: OK so I'm trying to visualize this whole three joint system I'm seeing the ankle as the fine tuner for the tip，the hip is the primary position setter like the master switch for your overall stance。 

Speaker 3: Yeah。the big lever。 

Speaker 2: And the knee is the dynamic controller for of absorbing and releaseing pressure throughout the arcade self they had to be perfectly Corey graph。 

Speaker 3: They absolutely must。and if we used that great knowledge from the source material。imagine your ski is a seesaw。 OK，your boot is the Falcon point，right in the middle。if you move your CM forward through that ankle flex or he pinge you are loading the front end of the seasa you're insuring the tip，presses down hard。 

Speaker 2: Which starss turn。 

Speaker 3: And if you let the CM slip off even just by letting your needs bent too much without that for he pinge you're pressing the tail the seasa down。 

Speaker 2: And losing the FRA？ 

Speaker 3: And you lose the turn，the goal isn't just to Keep the whole linked engaged it's to constantly find to in where that you know that one hundred percent pressure point seats shifting it's Suddenly forward to start the turn and then letting it move a little rare word to release the tale near the。 

Speaker 2: Finish and let's talk about consequences。what happens if we fail this little corrographic test if a skill let's their CM drift too far back。 

Speaker 3: Well，the immediate consequence is your effectively reducing the working radius of your skill。 Because the whole front section the shiver is no longer engaging with the snow it's。 

Speaker 2: Just flapping in the wind。 

Speaker 3: Pretty much so the tale section gets overloaded the skier often feels it're Suddenly excelerating out of control and they compensated by what do they do？they third the ski sideways。 

Speaker 2: They panic and skate to a stop。 

Speaker 3: Exactly that resulted in a huge skid excessive drag and a total loss of directional stability。 That classic back seat feeling isn't just uncomparable it's a total break down of the first fundamental。 

Speaker 2: OK，let's move this from the lab onto the snow we have another skier they're just transitioning out of the snow plow and they're really struggling to start their turn smoothly，they often skid right away。 

Speaker 3: A classic sign that they're after center they're not engaging the tip。 

Speaker 2: So in instructors priority here is to get them to feel that subtle forward pressure engage that boot on pressure。 But without having them do some exaggerated uncomparable forward Lin。 

Speaker 3: That's the trick it's about teaching unsolation of movement。 

Speaker 2: And that sounds really challenging。how do you make sure that when they focus on their ankle they are also，you know？ Unintentionally straightening their knee or collapseing at the hip。 

Speaker 3: That's the core challenge of isolation drews right？we have to break the cordinated movement down into its individual parts first，so the instruction probably start static Maybe just standing still across the slope and you ask the skill to focus only on their ankles，you say just push your shins gently into the fun of your boots。feel the change intention in the plastic don't move your needs or your hips。 They have to recognize that feeling of the weight shifting to the front of the food。 

Speaker 2: And then you do the opposite。 

Speaker 3: Then you switch maintain that ankle flex，but now only benjar needs a tiny bit and feel that suttle Conner shift backward let them feel how one joints movement can counter act another。 

Speaker 2: So the goal is for them to realize that a one sentimenter ankle movement has his profound influence on the ski tip whereas a big clumsy heapenge is really only only necessary for，you know。 Major touring changes or supergrassive terms。 

Speaker 3: Exactly once they can isolate that anchor movement the primary level for tip engagement we introduce dynamically on a very，very gentle slope the Q becomes begin at turn by leading with your shame。 

Speaker 2: Just the shame。 

Speaker 3: If the skill realizes，they can use their anchor for that fine tuning。they stop trying to use huge ine的hip and upper body movements from micro adjustments and that right there is the homark of transitioning from a beginner to an intermedia。 The ankle is the brain of the four F system the rest of the body just Fall as it's lead OK now let's simulate a really common point of confusion and it's related to that hip extension you need to exit a turn。 

Speaker 2: OK，I think I know where this is going。the student nasks，I feel like I'm leaning too far back when I tried to Stand up with my hips and then my skies just get out of control。I get pitched into the back seat。 

Speaker 3: Yeah。that's The One。 

Speaker 2: And this is a Perfect example of confucing a bio mechanical instruction extend the hip。 With the gross body movement，which is lean backward。the goal is to clarify that hip extension is about controlling pressure release not not initiating a Fall。 

Speaker 3: This misunderstanding comes entirely from the language of Stand up when we has instructors talk about extending at the help to finish the turn or transition we're talking about a really precise minimal control movement's。 

Speaker 2: Not like getting about of a。 

Speaker 3: Chair，not at all。it used to release pressure from the four body of the ski and let the tail flatten。 This less the same to move Suddenly after，but only for a moment to set up the next term。it should never break your athletic expense。 

Speaker 2: So how do we fix the image in their head because they are clearly visualize themselves falling backward down the mountain。 

Speaker 3: We have to counter that exaggerate the visual with The One of controlled precision，so you tell a listener，I imagine your standing up to gently pop a very small balloon that's please just by your Hills right inside the base of your boots。 

Speaker 2: Oh，it's good it's a tiny movement。 

Speaker 3: It's tiny it's process it's centered within your base of support and it's immediate your extending just enough to create that momentary pressure release at the tail，which helps flatten a ski and allowance for efficient rotational movement into the next dark。 

Speaker 2: And the direction of the movement is key。 

Speaker 3: Critically the movement is directed up toward the Sky not back toward the mountain this insurance the ghost days about controlling the flow of pressure maintaining that sees all balance。 And avoiding me sudden disruptive wait transfers that just dare the entire system。 

Speaker 2: OK so we've moving on from lanks wise four after pressure now we've got a tackle lateral pressure control as the second fund metal。 Getting the right，weight on the right ski。 

Speaker 3: And the fifth fundamental，which is managing the overall intensity of that weight。 

Speaker 2: Right。this is where skiing really separate itself from say walking this is about managing enormous siculical lot of forces。 

Speaker 3: It is in any balance。dynamic term were fighting centrifical force it's constantly trying to post street down the hell away from the center of the Ark were trying to make。 

Speaker 2: And to counter that。 You have to shift your way。 

Speaker 3: You have to shift your center of mask nifinly to the inside of the term。and that action is what generates massive GE force is。so the mechanics of it demand that the vast majority of that resulting force for talking up to eighte percent or more has to be chaneled onto the outside ski of the term。 

Speaker 2: So the outside ski is the power generator。 

Speaker 3: It's The One creating the curve it's doing all the work。 

Speaker 2: So we've got GE force is one way gravity point as another。 And we have to precisely minuver our CM to hardness，all these forces on The One single ski。this sounds like an aerospace problem。 

Speaker 3: It kind of is。 

Speaker 2: So how do we actually execute the shift mechanically with their bodies？ 

Speaker 3: We use two court nated movement patterns。and they have to happen at the same time。the first pattern is all in the lower body and it's focused on differential leg flaction。 

Speaker 2: Meeting one leg bends more than the。 

Speaker 3: Other exactly。 To effectively push pressure onto the outside ski the inside leg has get shorter than the outside leg。this means the knee and the hip of the inside leg have to flex deeper。 

Speaker 2: You're kind of falling it up in our knee。you。 

Speaker 3: You are you're deliberately absorbing or falling that inside legs your weight is naturally supported and directed onto the straighter Stronger outside legs。 

Speaker 2: That seems almost counter and two to balance，you know，making one Lake shorter than the other，but I guess it's necessary get the skies to tip on edge。 

Speaker 3: It is entirely necessary and here's the critical detail。our source is really emphasize while the needs and hips are flexing differently one more than the other the ankles have to maintain equal flexion relative to the boots。 

Speaker 2: Okay，so the shines stay at the same angle against the bootton。 

Speaker 3: They have do if your angle start flexing differently we immediately compromise that four after balance。we just spend so much time stability。 Which an enforcees the skill into these desperate recovery movements equal ancoflex maintains that stable CMBOS relationship blinked wise while the needs and hips are busy managing the letter weight distribution。 

Speaker 2: OK they're，make sense now for the second pattern，which involves the Uber body in the pelvis。this is the crucial almond of resistance of。 

Speaker 3: This is the high performance of们yeah，the Uber body your torso and pelvis has to face to the outside ski。 This is often called counter movement or angulation of the toursl so。 

Speaker 2: Is your legs or tipping into the turn？ 

Speaker 3: Your upper body is resisting it's providing a counter balance if you're torso just followed your legs and lean into the turn your whole center of mass would Fall too far inside and you lose pressure on that。all important outside ski you just collapse。 

Speaker 2: So by tilting toward the outside ski you're keeping your weight over it。 

Speaker 3: You're，actively aligning your center of math with what's called the resoltant force factor。 'S the combine the fact of gravity and centrifical force and that alignment is what allow the outside ski to accept and manage the enormous pressure of the term。 

Speaker 2: I absolutely love the anology here this complex movement lower body tipping again upper body providing outward resistance it's exactly like a fighterjet banking into a high G turn。 

Speaker 3: It's the Perfect。 The wings in the piece of that's your legs and skies they tip radically onto edge to create the turning geometry，but the pilot your uprobodian head has to stay oriented or Sometimes even slately counter tailed relative to the horizon and the force is involved your。 

Speaker 2: Torso is the stable controlling。 

Speaker 3: Unit it is it's maintaining balance and forward vision。while your legs are the dynamic tipping wings underneath just generating the Ark without that counter movement，the turn just falls apart。 

Speaker 2: OK，so that covers where the pressure goes，but now we have to tackle the fifth fundamental regulating the magnitude of the pressure this is about managing the intentity of the force that's generated by that ski snow and direction。 

Speaker 3: Right，the skies are constantly，creating force and we have to manage to maintain our speed and control。this is the skill of resisting and actively absorbing those forces that specificly the force is that pushing up through the ski halfway through the Ark。 

Speaker 2: And if you just different up and resist that force completely。 

Speaker 3: The force kicks you it thorzion to the Era of balance。but if you just collapse and of the over too much you scrub all your speed and you store the turn。 

Speaker 2: And the trampling principle is the Perfect visualization for this。 

Speaker 3: It really is imagine you're standing on a trampoline bouncing softly but you're explicitly trying not to jumpy right？ 

Speaker 2: Just maintaining contact。 

Speaker 3: To get that controlled continue as movement。 You have to precisely time when you bend your flaction and when you straighten your extension you're constantly modulating the interaction between your body way and that rebounding Surface。 

Speaker 2: So on skies that kinetic management is done through the constant，siculical flexing，an extending of the needs，the hips and even a little bit in the spine it's our suspension system。 

Speaker 3: It is the ultimate suspension system。 This dynamic movement allows the skill to manage the build up of pressure actively flexing and absorbing as the force is peak near the Fall line and then managing the decrease of pressure by extending slatly to maintain contact or prepare for the rotational change into the next turn。 

Speaker 2: And the Timing here seems like it's everything if the skill extends too early in the turn before those force is really peak。 

Speaker 3: They're factually pushing off the snow。 They accelerate vertically often lose contact with the snow and that leads to major instability。 

Speaker 2: I see that all the time。 

Speaker 3: Absolutely and Conversely if they absorb the pressure to late while they basically allow the force to dictate their movement and they've lost control for novices it's so important to emphasize that it slow spits and on gentle slopes the changes and magnitude are really slip。 

Speaker 2: So no big up and down movements。 

Speaker 3: Exactly exaggerated up and down movements are totally count of productive。 The force management needed is subtle just focusing on keeping the skies glue to the snow through constant minimal flection and extension our look。 

Speaker 2: Apply both of these concepts for lot of distribution in the force magnitude to an Inter media skier this person is now confidently hating medium Blue runs but they're getting bounced around by the more aggressive forces。 They look fast，but they look on stable。 

Speaker 3: Yeah，this is a common Plato the skier probably has adequate inclination in their lining in but they have poor absorption they're getting kicked around because they're meeting that incoming force with difference they're essential locking their shock absorbers。 

Speaker 2: To the instructional focus has to be on Timing the compression。 

Speaker 3: Right，Timing it for when the force are at their absolute maximum，which is typically，right as the skills cross the follow。 

Speaker 2: Line，so we need to teach them to consciously compress the turn。 

Speaker 3: That's the Q。 And the most effective physical way to teach this is to have them。consciously flexed their needs and hips into that compressions on tell the scare to imagine that they're shortening their body compressing in their core to smoothly fit into a lotono just at that moment of peak pressure。 

Speaker 2: And then extend out of。 

Speaker 3: It then they begin to extending smoothly again as they exit。the tunnel and the turn begins to finish this absorption let the skill manage that peak force by letting their powerful legmathals take the heat。 Rather than transferring that massive force directly up into their static core，which is what through the of balance。 

Speaker 2: So it's an active precise movement denied to these kids it's not a passive collapse。 

Speaker 3: Not at all，and I remember，you know，struggling with this idea for years，I felt like compressing men。I was slowing down me too。 

Speaker 2: Yeah，but it's actually opposite isn't it it lets you maintain your speed through the strongest part of the turn because you're providing that sudden loss of contact balance。 

Speaker 3: That's the key inside。 Managed compression alouse for higher speeds because it maintains control the difference between a controlled Ark and a kotic turn often just comes down to that few millo second of perfectly time to compression OK here's a false management question we hear all the time from skills who feel overwhelmed when the turning get steeper all。 

Speaker 2: Right let's hear it this still nasks I keep getting through on off balance near the bot of my turn specialty on the steeper part where I pick up speed。I feel like the ski is fighting me。 I just try to lean harder，all the。 

Speaker 3: Lean harder instinct the。 

Speaker 2: Instinct is to address the problem with more inclination but the real issue is vertical force management leaning harder only addresses your lotter or balance it won't do anything to absorb the vertical kick back that's created by the ski flexing so aggressively。 

Speaker 3: We have to correct that impulse and refocus on the dynamic movement of blags as the primary force manager。 And the best metaphor for this is to think of high performance shock，absorbers on a mountain bike OK when you hit a big bump and peak pressure on a steep turn is absolutely a big bump you'T stiffen up and lock your needs。if you did the force would rebound，sharkly and what either through you over the hand of bars or make you skip out？ 

Speaker 2: Right instead。 And expert mountain biker actively let's the shock absorbers compress great and then rebound smoothly they're absorbing the energy。 

Speaker 3: Processly your legs have to be active，they must。consciously compress absorbing that upward moving energy of the snow pushing back instead of letting that force kick you into the area through you off balance，the mental Q should be don't fight the force manage it。 

Speaker 2: So thinking down and then compressing my center of mass closer to this ski。 

Speaker 3: Yes rather than out in stiff，which just results in uncontrolled，rebounded。 Mastering this dynamic absorption that's the faith fundamental and action。 

Speaker 2: OK，so we establish how to manage forces both literally and link wise that's pressure control。now we move on to steering rotational control。this is the force fundamental and it dictates the actually direction this skies are pointed。 

Speaker 3: It's all about applying rotational movement to the skies without disrupting those pressure and Azure relationships with RT set up so when you're initiating and guiding a turn they're basically two ways to apply rotation。but only one of them is affected for you know，long term skill development and that is legitation。 

Speaker 2: The physics behind this choice seems pretty clear。control requires isolation。 

Speaker 3: Does let's start with the preferred method legitation whereas this movement actually reginate。and what makes it so much？ 

Speaker 2: Better let's do。 

Speaker 3: It legitation happens。exclusively at the hip sockets it's the famous rotating within the palvis。this movement controls the rotation of momentum of the skills and it happens undemy a relatively stable upper。 

Speaker 2: Body and it's the purity is in its precision。 

Speaker 3: It's in it's versatility and it's controll position yes，a scare condictate exactly how long the rotational input last。 The process of turn they want to initiate and the speed which that rotation happens Plus，and this is huge。you can control each ski independently，which is in valuable for managing uneven to rain or you know various snow textures。 

Speaker 2: So we're talking that steering the legs actively like a Rutter on a boat。 And just letting this keys wander，where they want that's a great image but beginners and I was happened to upper body rotation yeah，and that's where the chaos begins。 

Speaker 3: Oh，yeah，upper body rotation is when the sear turn the upper half first their shoulders。 And the legs is just kind of drag the long passively如。 

Speaker 2: Usually started with a big aggressive swing at the shoulders down the Hill。 

Speaker 3: That's the most common form of it？yeah，but it can range of that big of your shoulder，swing to a really subtle in turnalized turn of the pelvist that just pulls the legs with it。 

Speaker 2: So we connect this back to the bigger picture and the physics we talk to about a reallyer，what of the primary drawbacks of using the huge mass of the torso for steering。 

Speaker 3: The major drawback is all about angular momentum，and Timing。 Your tourist has a large moment of nursea。once that big Masters rotating it is extremely difficult to precisely control the duration the rate or the Timing？ 

Speaker 2: Of it。 

Speaker 3: And this often results in two critical errors first，the turn is initiated either two early or two late relative to the line that skill actually wants to hold。 Second the movement often causes the inside ski to begin turning before the outside ski。 

Speaker 2: And the second the inside ski is have lost all your control。 

Speaker 3: You have it causes a media directional instability because the turning force is just so poorly distributed across your base of support。the ski then has to use these large react of kind of movement。 

Speaker 2: Swing the hands out over edging like crazy。 

Speaker 3: All of it just to stop the unwonded rotation of amentum。 And that creates instability through the entire rest of the arc legitation just eliminates that whole cascade reactivity by initiating the turn locally quickly and precisely while keeping the upper body oriented down the Hill。focused on the task ahead，OK。 

Speaker 2: So let's that we have that transitioning beginner who is still swinging their shoulders were medically to start to turn they relying on that inevision upper body rotation。 How does an instructor break that habit and introduce pure isolated legs during。 

Speaker 3: The instructional focus has to be on physically restricting the upper body's ability to initiate the movement。 You have to emphasize stableization above the waste basically you have to reduce the tourist moment of in nursha during the term。 

Speaker 2: This definitely caused for that classic visual cute that every single ski instructor users。 

Speaker 3: It absolutely does you introduce a simple size slip or Maybe a tovers to or on a very gentle slope and the core instruction is to have them Keep their hands forward and still。 As if they're holding a delicate trade of drinks that they absolutely cannot。spill。 

Speaker 2: Right？the trade has to stay level fix relative to the four line。 

Speaker 3: And with the hands and by extension the shoulders are mobilized the skills forced to use only the small powerful muscles of the legs they have to steer，the skills back and for the cross。the slope exclusively from their hip sockets。 

Speaker 2: And that's a great dimension because it makes that separation feel achieveable they Suddenly realize。 Oh，I can steer，my feet without twisting my core and。 

Speaker 3: It connects right back to that fighter jet technology we used the upper body，is the cockpit fix and stable and the legs are the flat control services that move independently underneath they're practicing rotating the famous with the hip joint without any course bonding turning in the torso and that's building the nerlogical connection for isolated powerful steering。 Right time for a classic rotational confusion that who is happens right after the student successfully stop screening their shoulders。 

Speaker 2: OK，I'm ready the student next when I try to use just my legs，I feel stiff and I can't get my skied to really carve they just got a pivot and skied like an forceing the turn and that feeling of stiffness is so Violet because they're being asked to decouple major body parts the pilves in the legs，which for most of our lives moving Unison but that feeling of pivoting。 Reveals their confucian steering with just forcing the ski side way。 

Speaker 3: We have to validate the necessity of that separation。but then we have to clarify the process mechanism of rotation within the hip the torso should feel stable not stiff。 So you's a powerful grounding metaphor your upper body is a light house。 

Speaker 2: Fix steady oriented down the Hill。 

Speaker 3: Exactly it's reserving the entire trejectory of the turn it is stable relative to the slope。 

Speaker 2: And the legs are the boats writer，moving underneath。 

Speaker 3: Precisely，your legs are the boats Rutter moving Suddenly and powerful underneath that stable lighthouse that separation is the key to control you're not trying to force a sudden pivot that just gives the ski you are stiring the legs within the hip socket like like like rotating a key and a lock it's a gradually。 

Speaker 2: Movement so it's an internal rotation of the famous。 

Speaker 3: It is a precise steering input separate from the tour so and once the edgeser engage，which will get too next that smooth internal rotation is what allows the ski to hook up cleanly and carve the intended arc rather than being forced into a skid。 

Speaker 2: OK，we have managed the force we have managed the direction now we move to the final core skill edging control。this is the third fundamental skill，the geometry of ski。 It how we manipulate the angle of the ski realtive to the snow to create those beautiful clean carved arks。 

Speaker 3: Aging control is essential it's。what about you to hold a line，especially in heart，pack her eyes，the metal，edges or what group？the snow and we tip the ski onto it side to make them work。 

Speaker 2: And we do that through two complementary mechanical methods that I think beginners often confused yeah inclination and angulation。 

Speaker 3: What's start with inclination it's the simpler of the two concepts inclination is just moving your entire center of mass to the inside of the turn to balance against those overwhelming letter or force it's very similar to leaning an motorcycle or a bicycle into return the whole。 

Speaker 2: Body links is one。 

Speaker 3: Unit if it's done actually，yes，the motion should be similar the feet tip the needs tip the hips tip and the shoulders follow so the entire body is leaning into the Hill。 And the degree of inclination you need is directly proportional to the speed and the radius of your term。 

Speaker 2: So faster speed and tighter arts require more lean more inclination。 

Speaker 3: Exactly the critical error though is when skills use only upper body inclination。they just followed over at the waste without enough tipping from their feat legs。 

Speaker 2: The classic a frame stem。 

Speaker 3: That's The One if you only lean your tour，so you might feel balance Lately for a second。 But your feet art tipping the skies enough to generate the required edge angle and this results in minimal AG engagement，which then requires the skier to skit to complete the turn。 

Speaker 2: And that leads directly to the more complex higher performance mechanism。 

Speaker 3: Angelation this is about creating angles between your body parts it's the subtle separation that's an necessary to achieve a higher angle will still maintaining the stability of mass。 

Speaker 2: And we have two key texts here need angulation and hip angulation。 

Speaker 3: NE enclation is the most media one it's。when your lower leg is tipped more grasply than your upper leg creating an angle at the need joint this allowance for really quick fine adjustments of the edge angle and it's crucial and short terms where you just't have time for massive inclination it's a localized tipping movement and it's initiated primary by the food and ankle inside the boot。 

Speaker 2: And then he pingguation the more powerful one is vital for high speed RX。 

Speaker 3: Exactly。 Hip banglation is when your legs are tips significantly more than your upper body creating that necessary angle at the hipsocket this is vital for higher performance terms where you need to really aggressive edgangle high inclination but you also have to maintain your upper body centered over your base of support for balance and stability。 

Speaker 2: It's that fighter jet pilot resistance we Keep coming back to。 

Speaker 3: It is it allows the skill to counter act the letter of force without collapseing in Word。 And what's truly fascinating is how the source is emphasize that controlling the agenda isn't one single movement it's a complex interwoven dynamic of three fundamental skills all working at once。 

Speaker 2: The tipping lumen of the legs is never isolated。 

Speaker 3: Never it's a combination of tipping the feet and lower legs。that's angulation flexing the needs and hips for pressure magnitude control and the rotational input of stiring the legs。 And this complex dynamic blend is critical for two major reason，OK first it gives you extremely process fine tuned control over your adjango throughout the entire Ark and second and this is Maybe more important by distributing the turning force across，the multiple flexed and rotated joints it helps the scare avoid puting too much direct sharing letteral stress on the need joint，which is a major major consider that high speeds it's。 

Speaker 2: Help that in the media。 He wants to create clean car of shapes instead of skating all the time。they know they need to use their edges，but they engage them too late and it causes this sudden aggressive pivot they need early subtle aging engagement。 

Speaker 3: OK，we need to drill that force a media active tipping and angulation and it has to remove the confusion of any steering important。 So aside sipping drill on a gentle Trevor is the Perfect environment focuses purely on the tipping motion。 

Speaker 2: So how do we kill them to use that subtle in turnalized neenglation right at the very beating in the turn。 

Speaker 3: The instructor has to connect the movement to a very specific small motor function in the flute。 The instruction is to cue the sensation in the outside food by asking the skill to deliverly squash，a grape under the little toe of their outside。 

Speaker 2: Food that is highly specific it is。 

Speaker 3: And that's specific Q force is the food to tip literally inside the book，which a medialy drives in the inward and initiate that early need angelations。 

Speaker 2: So by focusing their mental energy on just the little toe they're engaging the edge before the major choice of you and started to move。 

Speaker 3: It completely aliminates that allay。 By focusing on that small toe action the skill engages the edge immediately at the start of the turn and that lives to a clean and non skating arcship。the immediate feedback。they get his autotory the scratchy sound of the aging gating early replace the louds ripping sound of skating later in the turn，all right now for the classic angelation confusion，and this one is all about the hips skills often here，hip angelation and they try to Fall themselves and half。 

Speaker 2: I've done this。this do not when I try to use my hips to angulate。 I feel like I'm breaking it the waste and's put in way too much pressure on my lower back。I just feel weak and this is a Perfect illustration of confucian forward bending a hinge with lateral angelation，which is more of a side bander of push they're initiating the angle by hinging forward。 Which just strains the back and pushes their CM two far inside the turn way to really。 

Speaker 3: We have to clarify that heaping gulation is a little movement it'S a push into the Hill，not a forward bull。the correcting metaphor needs to emphasize stability and a little push against the force so you use the image。 Hiping relation isn't baling forward it's pushing your hip literally into the Hill like you're trying to push your button to the tight pocket of a pair of jeans。 

Speaker 2: So we're talking about tilting the pilves not folding this spine。 

Speaker 3: Exactly the action is about maximizing。the angle between your legs in your toursole，while you're maintaining a strong athletic spin alignment。 Think about keeping your shoulder's level with the slope the lighthouse stay steady，while you're actively pushing your needs and hips away from the center of your body。 

Speaker 2: The angles should feel stable and supported。 

Speaker 3: It should feel intensely supported rooted by the strong engagement and compression of that outside leg not strained by folding your upper body forward or collapseing inward。that letter or push is what allows you to resist that massive centrifical force without losing your crucial edge。 Hashtag tactag outro。 

Speaker 2: Well，those in extremely throughout deep dive desecting the process coriography that's required to master Alpine skin we going from，you know，academic physics all it down to actionable joint movements。 

Speaker 3: And to quickly summarize the whole integrated system we covered the three core skills。 Pressure control，which is managing the false mangetutin distribution using those five fundamentals then rotational control which is steering with the legs from the hipsockets and finally edging control，which is tipping the ski using that complex combination of inclination and angelation。 

Speaker 2: And what's so crucial for you the listener to realize is that these three skills are constantly interwoven their interdependent you can't get optimal edge control without process pressure distribution。 

Speaker 3: And you can't manage pressure without smooth rotational input it's a constant feedback loop。 

Speaker 2: So let's connect the dots one final time let's look at the full turn cycle。 

Speaker 3: OK，the movements stars with controlling your center of mass relative to your base of support to manage that four after pressure that's your angle and hipset simultaneically you initiate the steer with active legitation。 The writer，movement right as the turn develops you manage the ski to ski pressure making true。the majority of the force is on that outside ski by using differential leg flexing and that upper body counter tilting，you get the high jangles，you need through a precise combination of inclination and angelation。 

Speaker 2: All while regulating，the magnitude of the force。 Absorbing that peak pressure with timely compression keeping the ski glue to the snow。 

Speaker 3: That's the whole dance。 

Speaker 2: It sounds like a thousand things happening it once，but when you break it down into these specific joint movements the ankle of the knee the hip it Suddenly becomes actionable you stop trying to try harder and you start trying to move precisely。 

Speaker 3: That is the ultimate goal of the steepedive and here's a final provocate of thought for you to carry up the care of the next time what's here。 The greatest difference between an Office and an expert skier lies not in how fast they can go，but in how skillfully they utilize resistance and absorption to manage the amens forces exerted by the snow so what's subtle movement that process shocks UPS or bertimeing in your legs are that little bit of ankle flex leading the turn。what are you going to focus on mastering next time you observe your own skin。 

Speaker 2: That's an excellent challenge knowing the mechanics really turn is the mountain from this overwhelming obstical cours into a focus。 Physical avatary，we hope this deep die that help she find that Perfect quite controlled art next time you hit the slopes until next time Keep exploreing。
