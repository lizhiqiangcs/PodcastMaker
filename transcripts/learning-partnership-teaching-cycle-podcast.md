## Introduction

**John**: Welcome back to Ski Mastery Podcast! I'm John, and Alice is here with me again. Today we're diving into two frameworks that are absolute game-changers for anyone who teaches skiing—or really, teaches anything.

**Alice**: Game-changers? That's a bold claim!

**John**: I stand by it! We're talking about the Learning Partnership and the Teaching Cycle. These are the blueprints that transform a random collection of activities into an engaging, effective lesson.

**Alice**: So this is like the architecture of a great lesson?

**John**: Perfect analogy! Last episode we talked about understanding the learner—CAP, Maslow, VAK. Today we're talking about the structure of the lesson itself. How do you actually orchestrate all the pieces to create something magical?

**Alice**: OK, I'm ready. Let's build this blueprint!

---

## The Learning Partnership: The Big Picture

**John**: Alright, let's start with the Learning Partnership. This model shows us that a great lesson isn't created by the instructor alone, and it's not just about the student showing up. It's a partnership—a dynamic collaboration between the student and the instructor.

**Alice**: So both parties bring something to the table?

**John**: Exactly! And when those two contributions combine in the right way, you get what we call the characteristics of a good lesson—engagement, fun, effectiveness, real learning.

**Alice**: So it's like a chemical reaction? Two elements combine to create something new?

**John**: I love that! Yes, it's a reaction. And the Learning Partnership model breaks it down into three parts: Student Makeup, Instructor Behavior, and the Characteristics of a Good Lesson that result when the first two combine effectively.

**Alice**: OK, break it down for me. What's Student Makeup?

### Student Makeup: What the Learner Brings

**John**: Student Makeup is everything the learner brings to the lesson. This includes their physical abilities, their emotional state, their goals and motivations, their past experiences, their fears, their learning preferences—basically, the whole package of who they are in that moment.

**Alice**: So it's like their current state—mind, body, and heart.

**John**: Exactly! And here's the key: as an instructor, you don't control Student Makeup. You can't change who they are or what they're bringing. But you absolutely need to understand it and work with it.

**Alice**: So it's about reading your student accurately.

**John**: Perfect! Let me give you some examples. Student Makeup might include:

A nervous adult who had a bad fall ten years ago and is terrified but determined to try again. That's their emotional state.

A physically gifted teenager who learns quickly but gets bored easily. That's their physical ability and attention span.

A six-year-old who just wants to have fun and doesn't care about "getting better." That's their motivation.

**Alice**: So every student brings a unique combination of factors.

**John**: Exactly! And your job as instructor is to gather information about that Student Makeup—assess it, understand it, honor it.

**Alice**: OK, so that's what the student brings. What about Instructor Behavior?

### Instructor Behavior: What the Teacher Brings

**John**: Instructor Behavior is everything you do as the teacher—how you communicate, how you structure the lesson, how you choose activities, how you provide feedback, how you create safety and trust. This is where you have total control.

**Alice**: So this is my side of the partnership.

**John**: Exactly! And great Instructor Behavior includes things like:

Building rapport and trust from the very first moment.

Assessing the student accurately—observing their skiing, asking good questions, listening deeply.

Setting clear, achievable goals that match the student's desires and abilities.

Presenting information in multiple ways—showing, telling, letting them feel.

Guiding practice effectively—choosing the right terrain, the right progressions, the right amount of challenge.

Checking for understanding along the way—are they getting it? Do we need to adjust?

Debriefing the experience—reflecting together on what was learned.

**Alice**: So it's like conducting an orchestra—you're managing all these different elements throughout the lesson.

**John**: Perfect analogy! And when you combine effective Instructor Behavior with an accurate understanding of Student Makeup, that's when the magic happens—the Learning Partnership is formed.

### The Learning Partnership: When It All Comes Together

**Alice**: So the partnership is the intersection of those two?

**John**: Exactly! It's where Student Makeup meets Instructor Behavior. When you truly understand your student and adapt your behavior to meet them where they are, a real partnership forms. They trust you, they're engaged, they're motivated, and learning flows naturally.

**Alice**: And that creates the characteristics of a good lesson?

**John**: Exactly! When the Learning Partnership is strong, you see characteristics like:

The student is engaged and having fun.

Learning is happening—real, measurable improvement.

The student feels safe, both physically and emotionally.

There's a sense of collaboration, not just instruction being delivered.

The student leaves feeling accomplished and excited to continue.

**Alice**: So those characteristics are the outcome—the proof that the partnership is working.

**John**: Perfect! And here's the beautiful thing: if a lesson isn't going well, you can use this model to diagnose what's missing.

### Using the Model to Troubleshoot

**Alice**: How do I do that?

**John**: Great question. Let's say you're teaching a lesson and it's just... flat. The student seems disengaged, progress is slow, the energy is low. Something's not working.

**Alice**: OK, so what do I do?

**John**: You reflect on the Learning Partnership model and ask: What's missing?

First, do I really understand the Student Makeup? Maybe I didn't ask enough questions. Maybe I don't know what's motivating them or what they're afraid of. I need to gather more information.

**Alice**: So go back and assess better.

**John**: Exactly! Second, is my Instructor Behavior effective? Maybe I jumped straight into technical instruction without building trust first. Maybe I'm using only auditory teaching and not showing them visually. Maybe I'm not checking for understanding.

**Alice**: So I reflect on my own behavior and adjust.

**John**: Exactly! And often, when you identify what's missing and address it—boom—the partnership clicks into place and the lesson transforms.

**Alice**: So it's a diagnostic tool!

**John**: Exactly! Let me give you a concrete example. You're teaching an adult beginner, and they're making very slow progress. You're frustrated, they seem frustrated. The lesson characteristics aren't there—no fun, minimal learning, low engagement.

**Alice**: So something in the partnership is broken.

**John**: Right. You reflect: What don't I know about their Student Makeup? You pause and ask some questions. Turns out, they're absolutely terrified but trying to hide it because their spouse loves skiing and they don't want to be left behind.

**Alice**: Ah! So there's a huge emotional factor you didn't know about.

**John**: Exactly! Now you understand the Student Makeup better. So you adjust your Instructor Behavior: you acknowledge their courage, you validate their fear, you slow down the progression, you choose even gentler terrain, you celebrate tiny wins.

**Alice**: So you're adapting your behavior to meet their emotional state.

**John**: Exactly! And suddenly the partnership forms. They trust you, they relax a bit, and learning starts to flow. The lesson transforms—not because you changed your skiing knowledge, but because you understood the partnership.

**Alice**: That's so powerful!

**John**: It really is. The Learning Partnership reminds us that teaching is a relationship, not just a delivery of information.

---

## The Teaching Cycle: The Roadmap

**John**: Alright, now let's zoom into the Instructor Behavior side of the Learning Partnership and break it down even further. This is where the Teaching Cycle comes in.

**Alice**: OK, so the Teaching Cycle is the detailed map of what I actually do as an instructor?

**John**: Exactly! It's the blueprint for structuring a lesson. The Teaching Cycle has seven key areas, and they provide the general flow of how a lesson unfolds.

**Alice**: Seven areas? That sounds like a lot to remember!

**John**: It does at first! But once you understand them, they become second nature. And here's the key: this isn't a rigid, linear checklist. It's a flexible cycle that you move through fluidly, sometimes circling back, sometimes jumping ahead based on what the student needs.

**Alice**: So it's more like a dance than a recipe?

**John**: Perfect! It's a dance. You know the steps, but you improvise the order based on your partner. Let me walk you through all seven areas, and then we'll talk about how they flow together.

### Step 1: Introduce the Lesson and Develop Trust

**John**: Step one is Introduce the Lesson and Develop Trust. This is the foundation of everything. Before any technical teaching happens, you establish rapport, safety, and clarity.

**Alice**: So this is the "getting to know you" phase?

**John**: Exactly! You introduce yourself, you learn names, you create a warm, welcoming energy. You might chat about where they're from, what they do, what brought them to skiing. You're building human connection.

**Alice**: So it's not just jumping straight to "Let's go ski"?

**John**: Definitely not! You're also setting expectations for the lesson. You explain what's going to happen, how long you'll be together, what the general flow will be. You're creating psychological safety—"I've got you, we're going to have fun, you're in good hands."

**Alice**: So trust is the outcome of this step.

**John**: Exactly! And trust is the foundation of the Learning Partnership. Without trust, nothing else works. A student who doesn't trust you won't take risks, won't be vulnerable, won't learn deeply.

**Alice**: So this step is crucial, even though it's not "teaching skiing" yet.

**John**: Exactly! And you can always come back to this step if trust starts to erode. Maybe something scary happens mid-lesson—you pause, you reassure, you rebuild trust.

### Step 2: Assess Students and Their Movements

**Alice**: OK, so we've built trust. What's next?

**John**: Step two: Assess Students and Their Movements. This is where you gather information about their Student Makeup—their skiing ability, their movement patterns, their physical capabilities, their comfort level.

**Alice**: So this is where I watch them ski?

**John**: Exactly! But it's more than just watching. You're also asking questions: What's your goal for today? Have you skied before? What do you love about skiing? What makes you nervous?

**Alice**: So you're assessing both the physical skiing and the emotional/mental state.

**John**: Perfect! And you're using all those Movement Analysis skills we talked about in a previous episode. You observe body performance and ski performance. You evaluate what's working and what's not.

**Alice**: So I'm building a complete picture of who they are as a skier.

**John**: Exactly! And here's the key: this step happens not just at the beginning, but continuously throughout the lesson. You're constantly assessing—watching, listening, adjusting your understanding.

**Alice**: So it's ongoing assessment, not a one-time thing.

**John**: Perfect!

### Step 3: Determine Goals and Plan Experiences

**Alice**: Alright, I've assessed them. Now what?

**John**: Step three: Determine Goals and Plan Experiences. This is where you collaborate with the student to figure out what you're working toward and how you'll get there.

**Alice**: So this is goal-setting?

**John**: Exactly! And the key word is collaborate. You don't just tell them what they're going to work on. You ask: What do you want to accomplish today? What would make this lesson a success for you?

**Alice**: So it's their goal, not just your instructor agenda.

**John**: Exactly! Now, sometimes their stated goal isn't realistic—maybe a never-ever skier says, "I want to ski black diamonds today." You don't just say yes. But you also don't shut them down. You adapt it: "That's an exciting goal! Let's build the foundation today so you're on track toward blacks. By the end of today, let's aim for you to be making controlled turns on a green run. Sound good?"

**Alice**: So you're honoring their ambition while guiding them toward achievable goals.

**John**: Perfect! And once you've agreed on goals, you plan experiences—what terrain will we use? What progressions? What activities? You're creating a roadmap based on their goal and your assessment.

**Alice**: So it's strategic planning.

**John**: Exactly! And just like assessment, this step is ongoing. Goals might shift mid-lesson. Maybe they master something faster than expected—you adjust the plan. Maybe they're more tired than expected—you adjust again.

### Step 4: Present and Share Information

**Alice**: OK, we've set goals and made a plan. Now we actually teach?

**John**: Now we teach! Step four: Present and Share Information. This is where you introduce new concepts, demonstrate techniques, explain the "why" and the "how."

**Alice**: So this is the VAK stuff—showing, telling, setting them up to feel it?

**John**: Exactly! You demonstrate the movement visually. You explain it verbally—"Here's what I'm doing with my ankles." You give them cues they can feel in their body—"Notice where you feel pressure in your feet."

**Alice**: So you're painting a complete picture of what they're about to try.

**John**: Perfect! And the key here is clarity and simplicity. You're not overwhelming them with every detail. You're giving them one or two key things to focus on—bite-sized chunks they can actually digest.

**Alice**: So less is more.

**John**: Exactly! It's better to give them one clear concept they can execute than five concepts they can't remember.

### Step 5: Guide Practice

**Alice**: So they've got the information. Now they try it?

**John**: Exactly! Step five: Guide Practice. This is where the student actually skis and applies what you've presented. And the key word here is guide—you're not just sending them off and hoping for the best. You're actively guiding.

**Alice**: What does that look like?

**John**: You choose appropriate terrain that matches the challenge level. You ski with them or near them, providing real-time feedback and encouragement. You structure the practice—maybe you say, "Make three turns focusing just on your ankle flex, then we'll pause and talk about it."

**Alice**: So you're creating focused, intentional practice.

**John**: Exactly! You're also keeping them safe, managing the environment, and adjusting the challenge level based on how they're doing. If it's too hard, you simplify. If it's too easy, you add complexity.

**Alice**: So you're actively managing the learning experience, not just passively watching.

**John**: Perfect!

### Step 6: Check for Understanding

**Alice**: And while they're practicing, I assume I'm watching to see if they're getting it?

**John**: Exactly! That's step six: Check for Understanding. This is where you verify that learning is actually happening. Are they executing the movement? Are they understanding the concept? Is it working?

**Alice**: So how do I check?

**John**: Multiple ways! You observe their skiing—do you see the change you're looking for? You ask questions—"What did you feel in that turn?" "How was that different from before?" You listen to their self-assessment—do they understand what's happening?

**Alice**: So you're gathering evidence of learning.

**John**: Exactly! And if understanding isn't there—if they're not getting it—you don't just push forward. You circle back. Maybe you re-present the information differently. Maybe you simplify the task. Maybe you ask more questions to figure out where the confusion is.

**Alice**: So it's a checkpoint—am I reaching them, or do I need to adjust?

**John**: Perfect! And this step happens constantly throughout practice. You're always checking, always gathering feedback.

### Step 7: Debrief the Learning Experience

**Alice**: OK, final step?

**John**: Step seven: Debrief the Learning Experience. This is where you and the student reflect together on what happened, what was learned, and what comes next.

**Alice**: So it's a wrap-up?

**John**: It's more than just a wrap-up—it's consolidation of learning. You might ask: "What was the biggest thing you learned today?" "What felt different?" "What are you going to keep working on?"

**Alice**: So they're articulating their own learning.

**John**: Exactly! And when they articulate it, it deepens and solidifies. They're not just physically doing something different—they're cognitively understanding what changed.

**Alice**: So the debrief turns experience into knowledge.

**John**: Beautifully said! And you also use this time to celebrate successes, reinforce key concepts, and set them up for their next skiing experience—whether it's later today or next season.

**Alice**: So you're sending them off with clarity and confidence.

**John**: Exactly!

## The Cycle Is Fluid, Not Linear

**John**: Alright, so we've walked through all seven steps of the Teaching Cycle. But here's the critical thing to understand: this isn't a rigid 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 checklist.

**Alice**: It's not?

**John**: Nope! The Teaching Cycle is fluid. You might bounce around. You might repeat steps. You might be in multiple steps simultaneously. It's a dynamic dance, not a linear march.

**Alice**: Give me an example of what that looks like in real life.

### Example: The Non-Linear Reality

**John**: Perfect. Let's say you're teaching an eight-year-old who's never skied before. You start with step one—introductions, building trust. "Hi, I'm John! What's your name? Have you ever been on skis before?"

**Alice**: Classic step one.

**John**: Right! But before you even finish your introduction, the kid blurts out: "I want to go off jumps like I saw on TV!"

**Alice**: Ha! So now you're suddenly in step three—goal setting—and you haven't even assessed them yet!

**John**: Exactly! So you adapt. You honor their excitement: "Jumps are so cool! I love that you're excited about that. Let's figure out what we need to learn first to get you ready for jumps safely." Now you've acknowledged their goal, and you circle back to step two—assessment.

**Alice**: So you're bouncing between steps based on what the student needs.

**John**: Exactly! Later in the lesson, you're in step five—guiding practice. They're making their first wedge turns. But suddenly they stop and say, "Wait, which ski is supposed to be the outside ski again?"

**Alice**: So they didn't understand something you presented earlier.

**John**: Right! So you immediately go back to step four—present information—and re-explain it. Then you check for understanding—step six—"Does that make sense now?" Then you continue guiding practice—back to step five.

**Alice**: So you're constantly flowing between steps based on what emerges!

**John**: Exactly! The cycle isn't rigid. It's responsive. You're using your professional judgment to decide: What does this student need right now? Which step of the cycle addresses that need?

**Alice**: So the cycle is a toolkit, not a script.

**John**: Perfect analogy! It's a toolkit. You know all the tools available, and you reach for the right one at the right moment.

---

## Practical Application: A Complete Lesson Flow

**John**: Let me walk you through a realistic lesson scenario that shows how the cycle flows naturally. Let's say you're teaching an intermediate adult who wants to improve their parallel turns.

**Alice**: OK, I'm listening.

### Beginning of Lesson

**John**: You meet at the base lodge. Step one—Introduce and Develop Trust. You greet them warmly, introduce yourself, chat a bit to build rapport. "How long have you been skiing? What do you love about it? What brought you to a lesson today?"

**Alice**: Building connection and trust.

**John**: Exactly! Then you transition to step two—Assess. "Let's take a few warm-up runs together so I can see what you're working with." You ski together, observing their movement, their comfort level, their current abilities.

**Alice**: Gathering information.

**John**: Right! On the chairlift, you move to step three—Determine Goals. "I noticed you're already making nice turns! What would you like to improve or work on today?"

They say: "I feel like I'm skidding through my turns. I want to learn to carve."

**Alice**: Perfect—they've given you a clear goal!

**John**: Exactly! So you collaborate: "Great goal! Clean carving is so satisfying. Let's focus on edge control and fore-aft balance today. Sound good?" They agree. Now you've established a shared goal.

### Middle of Lesson

**John**: You get off the lift and move to step four—Present Information. You demonstrate a carved turn, pointing out how you're tipping your feet early and maintaining forward pressure. "See how my skis are leaving thin lines in the snow instead of wide skids?"

**Alice**: Visual and verbal presentation.

**John**: Exactly! Then step five—Guide Practice. "Let's try this on the next run. Focus on tipping your feet early in each turn and feeling pressure in the front of your boots."

They ski down, and you observe. Step six—Check for Understanding. You watch their skiing. The turns are better, but they're still skidding the last third of each turn.

**Alice**: So partial understanding—they've got part of it.

**John**: Exactly! So you circle back to step four—Present Information again. "You're getting great early edge engagement! Now let's talk about maintaining that pressure all the way through the finish of the turn." You demonstrate again, emphasizing the finish.

**Alice**: Re-presenting based on what you observed.

**John**: Exactly! Back to step five—Guide Practice. They try again. This time, cleaner turns! Step six—Check for Understanding. "How did that feel? Did you notice a difference?"

They say: "Yes! I could feel the ski grabbing more!"

**Alice**: They're getting it!

**John**: Exactly! So you continue practicing, checking, refining. Maybe partway through, they ask, "Why does tipping my feet early matter?" So you circle back to step four—Present Information—and explain the "why."

**Alice**: So you're constantly flowing between presenting, practicing, and checking.

**John**: Exactly!

### End of Lesson

**John**: Near the end of the lesson, you move to step seven—Debrief. On the final chairlift, you ask: "So what's the biggest thing you learned today?"

**Alice**: Consolidating the learning.

**John**: Exactly! They say: "I learned that I need to tip my feet earlier and keep pressure forward through the whole turn. And I can actually feel the difference when I do it right!"

**Alice**: They've articulated their own learning!

**John**: Perfect! You reinforce it: "Exactly! And that awareness you developed—feeling when the ski grabs versus when it skids—that's going to be your best teacher going forward. Keep practicing that on your own."

**Alice**: So you're empowering them to continue learning independently.

**John**: Exactly! And you've completed the full cycle—but not in a rigid 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 order. You flowed between steps based on what the student needed in each moment.

---

## The Responsibility Code: Safety as Foundation

**John**: Before we wrap up, I want to touch on one more crucial element that underlies all of this: safety. We have what's called the Responsibility Code—ten principles that govern safe skiing and snowboarding.

**Alice**: Is this like the rules of the mountain?

**John**: Exactly! And as instructors, we have a duty to teach these principles, not just skiing technique. Safety is the foundation that everything else is built on.

**Alice**: What are the key principles?

**John**: Here are the big ones: Always stay in control—you need to be able to stop or avoid people and objects. People ahead of or downhill from you have the right of way—you must avoid them. Stop only where you're visible from above and don't block traffic.

**Alice**: So it's about controlling yourself and respecting others.

**John**: Exactly! Other key ones: Look uphill before starting downhill or merging onto a trail. Prevent runaway equipment. Read and obey all signs and warnings. Stay off closed trails. Know how to load, ride, and unload lifts safely.

**Alice**: So basically, be in control, be aware, and be respectful.

**John**: Perfect summary! And don't ski when impaired by alcohol or drugs. And if you're involved in any collision, share your contact info.

**Alice**: So these are non-negotiables.

**John**: Exactly! And we weave these principles into our lessons constantly. When we're guiding practice, we're choosing safe terrain. When we're presenting information, we're explaining why control matters. When we're building trust, we're demonstrating that safety is our top priority.

**Alice**: So the Responsibility Code isn't separate from the Teaching Cycle—it's embedded in it.

**John**: Exactly! Safety is the container that holds everything else.

---

## Common Mistakes with the Teaching Cycle

**John**: Alright, before we close, let's talk about common mistakes instructors make with the Teaching Cycle.

**Alice**: What should I avoid?

### Mistake 1: Skipping Steps

**John**: Mistake number one: skipping steps, especially the early ones. Instructors who are eager to teach will skip the trust-building or the goal-setting and jump straight to presenting information and guiding practice.

**Alice**: So they're trying to teach before the foundation is there?

**John**: Exactly! And the lesson feels hollow. The student isn't engaged because there's no rapport. Or they're working on the wrong thing because you never established shared goals.

**Alice**: So don't skip steps, even if they seem less important.

**John**: Exactly! Every step matters.

### Mistake 2: Treating It as Linear

**John**: Mistake number two: treating the cycle as a rigid, linear checklist. Instructors think, "I did step one, now I must do step two, now I must do step three," without responding to what the student actually needs.

**Alice**: So they're following a script instead of dancing with the student.

**John**: Perfect! The cycle is a guide, not a script. You have to stay responsive and fluid.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting to Check for Understanding

**John**: Mistake number three: forgetting to check for understanding. The instructor presents information, guides practice, but never actually verifies that learning is happening.

**Alice**: So they just assume it's working?

**John**: Exactly! And sometimes it's not. The student is confused or executing incorrectly, and the instructor just keeps moving forward. Always check for understanding!

### Mistake 4: Skipping the Debrief

**John**: And mistake number four: skipping the debrief. The lesson ends, and the instructor just says, "Great job today! See you later!" without any reflection or consolidation.

**Alice**: So the learning doesn't get solidified.

**John**: Exactly! The debrief is where experience transforms into understanding. Don't skip it!

## Closing Thoughts

**John**: Alright Alice, let's bring it home. We've covered the Learning Partnership and the Teaching Cycle. What are your big takeaways?

**Alice**: OK, big takeaway number one: teaching is a partnership between Student Makeup and Instructor Behavior. When those combine effectively, you get engagement, fun, and real learning.

**John**: Perfect!

**Alice**: Takeaway number two: the Teaching Cycle gives me a roadmap—seven steps that guide how I structure and flow through a lesson.

**John**: Exactly!

**Alice**: And takeaway number three: the cycle isn't rigid. It's fluid. I need to respond to what the student needs in each moment, bouncing between steps as necessary.

**John**: Perfect synthesis! And here's the beautiful thing: when you master the Learning Partnership and the Teaching Cycle, teaching stops feeling like you're making it up as you go. You have a structure, but within that structure, you have total creative freedom.

**Alice**: It's like jazz—you know the chord changes, but you improvise the melody.

**John**: That's a perfect analogy! You know the framework, but every lesson is unique because every student is unique.

**Alice**: So these tools give me confidence and clarity as a teacher.

**John**: Exactly! Now, here's my challenge for you: Next time you teach—whether it's skiing or anything else—consciously move through the Teaching Cycle. Notice when you're introducing and building trust. Notice when you're assessing. Notice when you're presenting versus guiding practice. Build that awareness.

**Alice**: So I'm making the implicit explicit.

**John**: Beautifully said! And when a lesson isn't going well, use the Learning Partnership model to diagnose: Do I understand my student's makeup? Is my instructor behavior effective? What's missing?

**Alice**: So these frameworks turn me from an accidental teacher into an intentional one.

**John**: Perfect! Alright everyone, we hope the Learning Partnership and Teaching Cycle give you a clear blueprint for creating engaging, effective lessons. Remember: it's a partnership, it's a cycle, and it's always fluid.

**Alice**: Until next time, keep teaching!

**John**: Happy skiing!
