## Introduction

**John**: Welcome back to Ski Mastery Podcast! I'm John, and Alice is here with me again. Last time we talked about the three core skill concepts—pressure, rotation, and edging. Today, we're going one level deeper.

**Alice**: Deeper? I thought we were already pretty deep!

**John**: Ha! Well, today we're getting into the operational manual—the five fundamentals. These are the specific, repeatable movements that actually make those three skills happen on the snow.

**Alice**: So the three concepts are what we're trying to achieve, and the five fundamentals are how we achieve them?

**John**: Exactly! Think of the three concepts as the goals, and the five fundamentals as the specific body movements—the actual choreography—that get you there.

**Alice**: OK, I'm ready. What are these five fundamentals?

**John**: Alright, here they are. Fundamental number one: controlling the relationship between your center of mass and your base of support to manage fore-aft pressure. Number two: directing pressure from ski to ski, specifically to the outside ski. Number three: controlling edge angles through inclination and angulation. Number four: steering the skis with leg rotation, separate from your upper body. And number five: regulating the magnitude of the forces throughout the turn.

**Alice**: That's... a lot of technical language. Can we break these down one by one?

**John**: Absolutely. That's exactly what we're going to do. Let's start with fundamental number one.

---

## Fundamental 1: Center of Mass Over Base of Support

**John**: The first fundamental is all about controlling the relationship between your center of mass—we'll call it CM—and your base of support, which is just your skis. We'll call that BOS.

**Alice**: So CM over BOS. That sounds like a physics equation.

**John**: It kind of is! But here's the practical version: your center of mass is roughly at your belly button, and your base of support is the length of your skis. The question is: where does your CM sit relative to that length?

**Alice**: And why does that matter?

**John**: Because that relationship determines your fore-aft pressure—where the pressure sits along the ski. Is it on the tip? The middle? The tail?

**Alice**: Right, we talked about this with the seesaw analogy last time.

**John**: Exactly. Your boot is the fulcrum, and your CM is the weight. Move it forward, and you pressure the tip. Let it slide back, and you're stuck in the backseat with all your weight on the tail.

**Alice**: And the backseat is bad.

**John**: The backseat is very bad. You lose control of the ski's sidecut, you can't initiate turns cleanly, and you end up skidding everywhere.

### The Three-Joint Orchestra

**Alice**: So how do we actually control this CM-over-BOS relationship?

**John**: This is where those three joints come in—ankle, knee, hip. And they have to work together like an orchestra.

**Alice**: Orchestra again. So each joint plays a different instrument?

**John**: Exactly. The ankle is your fine-tuner—it's the violin, if you will. Small movements, huge impact. If you flex your ankle just a centimeter—push your shin into the boot tongue—your CM shifts forward and pressure goes to the tip.

**Alice**: And if I relax my ankle?

**John**: Pressure moves back toward the tail. It's instant and subtle.

**Alice**: OK, so ankle is the fine-tuner. What about the knee?

**John**: The knee is tricky because it works inversely. It's like the bass section—it provides the foundation, but it can throw everything off if you're not careful.

**Alice**: Inversely? What do you mean?

**John**: If you bend your knees—like really flex them, bringing your heels toward your glutes—your CM actually moves backward, not forward.

**Alice**: Wait, so if I'm trying to get forward by bending my knees, I'm actually going backward?

**John**: Exactly! That's the paradox. Knee flexion alone moves you aft. You have to combine it with ankle flexion and hip hinge to stay balanced.

**Alice**: This is why "just bend your knees" is terrible advice.

**John**: Terrible advice! Unless it's qualified. The knee is really about dynamic absorption and extension—it's the shock absorber, not the primary fore-aft controller.

**Alice**: Got it. So what about the hips?

**John**: The hips are the big engine—the percussion section. They set the overall stance. If you hinge forward at the hips, like you're bowing, your CM moves decisively forward. If you extend your hips, like you're standing tall, your CM moves back.

**Alice**: So the hips are the master switch.

**John**: The master switch. And here's the key: all three joints have to work in perfect coordination. Ankle for fine-tuning, hip for big adjustments, and knee for dynamic absorption throughout the turn.

### Common Mistakes

**Alice**: OK, so what happens when this goes wrong? Like, what does it actually feel like on the hill?

**John**: Great question. Let's say you're an intermediate skier on a blue run, and you're struggling to start your turns smoothly. You keep skidding right at the initiation.

**Alice**: That sounds familiar.

**John**: That's a classic sign that you're aft of center. Your CM has slipped back, so you're not engaging the tip of the ski. The whole front section—the shovel—is just flapping in the wind.

**Alice**: So how do you fix it?

**John**: You actively increase ankle flexion and hinge slightly at the hips. You're pulling that CM back over the sweet spot—the middle of the ski. And you do this right before you initiate the turn.

**Alice**: So it's a proactive movement, not reactive.

**John**: Exactly. You're anticipating where you need the pressure to be, not reacting to being out of balance.

---

## Fundamental 2: Ski-to-Ski Pressure Transfer

**John**: Alright, fundamental number two: directing pressure from ski to ski, and specifically making sure the vast majority of force lands on your outside ski.

**Alice**: The outside ski. That's the downhill ski in a turn, right?

**John**: Exactly. And the golden rule is that about 80% of your weight should be on that outside ski during a carved turn.

**Alice**: Eighty percent? So the inside ski is basically just tagging along?

**John**: It's there for balance and subtle adjustments, but it's much lighter. The outside ski is doing the heavy lifting—literally.

**Alice**: So how do we actually get 80% of our weight onto one ski?

### The Two Coordinated Movements

**John**: It requires two coordinated movements happening simultaneously. First, differential leg flexion.

**Alice**: Differential leg flexion. That sounds fancy.

**John**: It just means your inside leg gets shorter than your outside leg. You flex the knee and hip more on the inside leg.

**Alice**: So I'm kind of collapsing inward?

**John**: Not collapsing—that sounds passive. You're actively shortening the inside leg to allow your body to tip into the turn. But here's the critical part: both ankles stay equally flexed.

**Alice**: Why is that critical?

**John**: Because if you straighten your inside ankle while shortening the leg, you'll mess up your fore-aft balance. You'll end up in the backseat.

**Alice**: Everything comes back to that backseat.

**John**: It really does. Now, here's the second movement, and it's counterintuitive: while your legs are tipping into the turn, your upper body—your torso—has to tilt toward the outside ski, downhill.

**Alice**: Wait, that feels backward. I always thought you lean your chest into the turn.

**John**: I know! But think about it: your legs are already tipping inward. If your upper body just followed them, you'd collapse to the inside and lose all pressure on that outside edge.

**Alice**: So by tilting my torso outward, I'm creating a counterbalance.

**John**: Exactly. That's angulation. And that counterbalance is what keeps the maximum pressure on the outside ski so it can carve cleanly.

### The Fighter Jet

**Alice**: This is like the fighter jet analogy, right? The wings bank radically, but the cockpit stays oriented?

**John**: Perfect! The legs are the wings, tipping aggressively. The torso is the cockpit, staying relatively stable and oriented downhill.

**Alice**: And that separation is what drives the pressure to the outside ski.

**John**: Exactly. Without that separation, you'd just be leaning into the hill with no edge grip.

### What Happens When It Goes Wrong

**Alice**: So what does it feel like when you're not getting enough weight on the outside ski?

**John**: You'll feel unstable and squirrelly. The outside ski won't hold, and you'll end up skidding or catching the inside edge. Some people call it the "A-frame" stance—knees knocked together, not enough angulation.

**Alice**: And the fix is to actively shorten that inside leg and tilt the torso outward?

**John**: Exactly. Think about pushing your outside hip into the hill while letting the inside leg fold up underneath you.

## Fundamental 3: Edge Angle Control

**John**: Alright, fundamental number three: controlling the angle of your edges on the snow using two tools—inclination and angulation.

**Alice**: We touched on this before, but let's go deeper. What's the difference again?

### Inclination

**John**: Inclination is simpler. It's moving your entire center of mass to the inside of the turn. Think of leaning a motorcycle into a corner—the whole body tips as one unit.

**Alice**: So everything moves together?

**John**: Exactly. When done correctly, it happens from the feet up to the head—your feet tip, your knees tip, your hips tip, your shoulders follow. The degree of inclination is directly proportional to your speed and turn radius.

**Alice**: So faster and tighter turns need more lean.

**John**: Precisely. But here's where a lot of intermediate skiers go wrong: they lean their upper body into the turn while their feet and legs don't tip enough.

**Alice**: Oh, so the chest goes in but the skis stay flat?

**John**: Exactly. It's like folding at the waist instead of tipping from the feet. And the problem is, you might feel balanced momentarily, but you're not actually tipping your skis enough to get the edge angle you need. You'll skid through the turn.

**Alice**: So inclination alone isn't enough.

**John**: Right. If you only use inclination—if you don't add angulation—you either don't get enough edge angle, or you have to lean so far into the hill that you become unstable.

**Alice**: So that's where angulation comes in.

### Angulation

**John**: Right. Angulation is creating angles between body parts. It's more complex, more subtle, and higher performance. And this is what really unlocks precise edge control.

**Alice**: Break it down.

**John**: There are two main types. First, knee angulation. This is where your lower leg tips more aggressively than your upper leg, creating an angle at the knee joint.

**Alice**: So my shin is tipped way over, but my thigh isn't as much?

**John**: Exactly. It allows quick, fine adjustments of edge angle, and it's crucial in short, quick turns where you don't have time for massive whole-body inclination.

**Alice**: And the second type?

**John**: Hip angulation. This is where your legs tip significantly more than your upper body, creating a clear angle at your hip socket. You see this in high-performance carving—the skier's legs are almost flat on the snow, but the torso is still pretty upright and centered.

**Alice**: So you're maximizing the edge angle while keeping your center of mass stable.

**John**: Exactly. And here's a great cue: hip angulation isn't about bowing forward—it's about pushing your hip laterally into the hill.

**Alice**: Like pushing a button into a tight pocket.

**John**: Perfect! You're tilting your pelvis sideways, not folding your spine forward.

**Alice**: Now, I've heard that angulation is important for protecting your knees. Is that true?

**John**: Absolutely. And this is critical. When you use the feet and legs to control edge angles—combining tipping the feet, flexing the knees and hips, and leg rotation—you're distributing the turning forces across multiple joints.

**Alice**: Instead of putting all the stress on one joint.

**John**: Exactly. If you try to get high edge angles by just forcing your knees sideways, you're putting massive lateral stress on the knee joint. That's a recipe for injury, especially at high speeds.

**Alice**: So angulation isn't just about performance—it's about safety too.

**John**: Exactly. It's a precise, safe way to control edge angles. You're using your whole kinetic chain—feet, ankles, knees, hips—working together, rather than overloading any single joint.

### The Grape Under Your Little Toe

**Alice**: OK, so conceptually I get it. But how do I actually feel this in my body when I'm skiing?

**John**: Here's one of my favorite teaching cues: imagine you're squashing a grape under the little toe of your outside foot.

**Alice**: A grape under my little toe?

**John**: I know it sounds weird. But this highly specific cue forces your foot to tip laterally inside the boot. And that immediately drives the initiation of knee angulation.

**Alice**: So I'm getting early edge engagement.

**John**: Exactly. By focusing on that little toe, you engage the edge before your major body mass even starts to move. It eliminates the delay.

**Alice**: And I can hear the difference, right? Clean edge engagement versus that loud skidding sound.

**John**: Exactly. It's like the difference between a knife cutting cleanly through butter versus scraping across it.

### Common Mistake: Inclination Without Angulation

**Alice**: So what does it look like when someone is using inclination without enough angulation?

**John**: Great question. Picture this: a skier is making medium-radius turns on a groomed blue run. They're leaning their upper body into each turn—you can see their shoulder dropping toward the hill.

**Alice**: So they're inclining.

**John**: They think they are. But look at their feet and legs—they're staying relatively flat to the snow. The skier is basically folding at the waist, leaning their torso in, but their skis aren't tipping enough.

**Alice**: So what happens?

**John**: They can't hold the edge. The skis skid out, they lose the arc, and they have to muscularly force the skis around to complete the turn. It's exhausting and imprecise.

**Alice**: So the fix is to tip from the feet up, not fold from the waist down.

**John**: Exactly. Inclination should happen from the feet all the way up to the head. And then you add angulation—those angles at the knee and hip—to maximize edge angle while keeping your center of mass stable.

**Alice**: So it's inclination with angulation, not one or the other.

**John**: Exactly. They work together. Inclination balances against the lateral forces, and angulation gives you the edge angle you need to carve cleanly.

## Fundamental 4: Leg Rotation

**John**: Fundamental number four: steering the skis using active leg rotation, and this is the key part—separate from your upper body.

**Alice**: So this is all about that separation we keep talking about.

**John**: Exactly. The ideal is leg rotation—the legs are moving independently inside the hip socket, controlling the direction of the skis, while your upper body stays quiet and stable.

**Alice**: And why is that so important?

### Precision vs. Chaos

**John**: It all comes down to precision. When you steer with your legs, you control everything: the duration, the amount, the rate, the speed of the turn. You have surgical precision.

**Alice**: And what happens when you steer with your whole body?

**John**: That's upper body rotation. When you lead with your torso—throwing your shoulders downhill—the legs are just passively dragging along. And it's almost impossible to control.

**Alice**: I remember doing that when I was learning. I'd wind up like a spring and then just unload everything into the turn.

**John**: Classic pitfall. You get this really abrupt, jerky start to the turn, and then it's hard to stop the rotation. Your inside ski often turns first, which destroys the pressure application we just talked about.

**Alice**: And once you've started that upper body rotation, you're committed, right?

**John**: Exactly. Here's the problem: your torso has a huge moment of inertia. Once it starts rotating, it wants to keep rotating. And then you have to use another movement—usually an awkward counter-rotation—to stop the skis from over-turning.

**Alice**: So you're constantly fighting yourself.

**John**: Exactly. You initiate with your shoulders, then you have to fight to stop the turn, then you wind up the other direction, then you fight again. It's exhausting and imprecise.

**Alice**: So the rule is: legs steer, upper body stays quiet.

**John**: Exactly. Keep the core calm, let the legs do the work. That way you maintain precision and control throughout the entire turn.

### The Tray of Drinks Drill

**Alice**: But how do you actually teach someone to do that? It's so counterintuitive.

**John**: One of my favorite drills is the tray of drinks. Imagine you're holding a delicate tray of drinks in front of you—like a fancy waiter—and you absolutely cannot spill them.

**Alice**: OK, I'm visualizing it.

**John**: Now, with your hands and shoulders immobilized like that, try to steer your skis back and forth across the slope. You're forced to use only your legs. You have to steer exclusively from your hip sockets.

**Alice**: So you're physically restricting the upper body's ability to rotate.

**John**: Exactly. And that forces you to develop the neurological connection for isolated leg rotation. It's the lighthouse and the rudder, right? The lighthouse—your upper body—stays fixed and oriented downhill. The rudder—your legs—moves subtly underneath, steering the boat.

**Alice**: I love that metaphor.

### Common Confusion

**Alice**: OK, so I've got a student who says, "When I try to steer with just my legs, I feel stiff and locked up. My skis just pivot and skid instead of carving."

**John**: That's a super common issue. The stiffness is normal—you're decoupling movements that normally happen together. But the pivoting reveals a misunderstanding.

**Alice**: What's the misunderstanding?

**John**: They're confusing steering with forcing the skis sideways. Leg rotation isn't about suddenly pivoting the skis. It's about smooth, internal rotation of the femurs within the hip socket—like rotating a key in a lock, gradually.

**Alice**: So it's a subtle, continuous rotation, not a sudden twist.

**John**: Exactly. And once the edges engage—thanks to fundamental number three—that smooth rotation allows the ski to hook up cleanly and carve the intended arc, rather than skidding.

---

## Fundamental 5: Force Magnitude Regulation

**John**: Alright, the fifth and final fundamental: regulating the magnitude of the forces—basically, managing the sheer intensity of the pressure you create throughout the turn.

**Alice**: So this is about how much force, not just where the force is.

**John**: Exactly. And here's the thing: when you're just standing still, the force is just your body weight. But the moment you start carving a turn, especially at speed, the snow can push back with force that exceeds twice your body weight.

**Alice**: Twice my body weight? That's insane!

**John**: It is! So you can't just stand there rigid and hope for the best. You have to actively manage that force.

### The Trampoline

**Alice**: And how do we do that?

**John**: Imagine you're on a trampoline. You're bouncing softly, but you're trying not to get launched into the air. What do you do?

**Alice**: I'd constantly flex and extend my knees and hips to absorb the bounce.

**John**: Exactly! You're not standing there stiff as a board. You're absorbing the peaks of the force by flexing, and then extending to generate new force when you need it.

**Alice**: So it's dynamic, not static.

**John**: Exactly. And the same thing happens in skiing. You're constantly flexing and extending throughout the turn to manage the build-up and release of pressure.

**Alice**: Absorbing versus resisting.

**John**: That's the key distinction. If you resist—if you stiffen up and fight the force—you'll get bounced around and lose control. But if you absorb—if you actively compress at the right moment—you maintain control and keep the skis glued to the snow.

### Timing Is Everything

**Alice**: So when do I compress, and when do I extend?

**John**: Timing is everything. You want to compress—flex your knees and hips—right as the force peaks, which is usually near the fall line. That's when the ski is bending the most and the snow is pushing back the hardest.

**Alice**: So I'm absorbing that peak.

**John**: Exactly. Then, as the turn finishes and the force decreases, you extend smoothly to maintain contact with the snow and set up the next turn.

**Alice**: It's like a suspension system on a car.

**John**: Or a mountain bike! You let your legs actively compress to absorb the bumps. You don't lock your knees and fight the terrain.

### What It Feels Like

**Alice**: So what does it feel like when this goes wrong?

**John**: Let's say you're on a steep section, and you keep getting thrown off balance near the bottom of your turn. Your skis feel like they're fighting you.

**Alice**: Yeah, I've felt that.

**John**: Your instinct is to lean harder—to pressure the ski more. But the real issue is vertical force management. Leaning harder only addresses lateral balance. It won't absorb the vertical kickback from the aggressively flexing ski.

**Alice**: So what's the fix?

**John**: Actively compress your center of mass closer to the ski as the force peaks. Don't stiffen and lock your knees. Let your legs act like shock absorbers. The mental cue is: "Don't fight the force, manage it."

**Alice**: Manage it, not fight it. I like that.

## Putting It All Together

**John**: Alright Alice, we've covered all five fundamentals. Now let's talk about how they work together in a real turn.

**Alice**: Because they don't happen in isolation, right?

**John**: Right. They're constantly interwoven. Let me walk you through a complete turn cycle and show you how all five fundamentals are firing simultaneously.

### The Complete Turn Cycle

**John**: Imagine you're finishing a turn and transitioning into the next one. Here's what's happening:

**Fundamental 1** is at work: You're controlling your CM over your BOS. As you finish the turn, you extend your hips slightly to release pressure and flatten the skis. Then, as you initiate the next turn, you flex your ankle and hinge at the hip to drive pressure forward onto the new outside ski's tip.

**Fundamental 2** kicks in: You're transferring pressure from the old outside ski to the new outside ski. Your new inside leg shortens, and your torso tilts toward the new outside ski to create that counterbalance.

**Fundamental 3** is happening: You're controlling edge angles through a complex combination of movements. You squash that grape under your little toe to tip your feet, you flex your knees and hips to create angulation, and you use leg rotation to help tip the skis. All of these movements work together to create the precise edge angle you need—and they distribute the forces safely across your whole kinetic chain rather than stressing just your knees.

**Fundamental 4** is working: You're steering with leg rotation. Your femurs are rotating smoothly in the hip sockets, turning the skis, while your upper body stays quiet and oriented downhill like a lighthouse.

**Fundamental 5** is active throughout: You're regulating force magnitude. You compress—flex your knees and hips—as the force builds through the middle of the turn, absorbing that peak pressure near the fall line. Then you extend as the turn finishes to release pressure and transition smoothly.

**Alice**: So all five fundamentals are happening at once, in perfect coordination.

**John**: Exactly. It's like a symphony. Each fundamental is an instrument, and they all have to play together in harmony.

**Alice**: That's... a lot.

**John**: It is! But here's the beautiful part: you don't have to think about all five at once. You pick one to focus on—maybe it's that ankle flexion to engage the tip, or that timely compression at the fall line—and the rest will start to fall into place.

**Alice**: So it's about isolating one movement and really nailing it.

**John**: Exactly. Master one fundamental, and it improves the others. They're that interconnected.

---

## Closing Thoughts

**John**: Alright, let's wrap up with a quick review. We covered five fundamentals:

Number one: Controlling CM over BOS for fore-aft pressure using ankle, knee, and hip coordination.

Number two: Directing pressure ski to ski, getting 80% onto the outside ski with differential leg flexion and upper body counter-tilt.

Number three: Controlling edge angles through inclination and angulation, using that grape-under-the-little-toe cue for early engagement.

Number four: Steering with leg rotation, keeping the upper body quiet and stable like a lighthouse.

Number five: Regulating force magnitude with dynamic absorption and extension, like a trampoline or suspension system.

**Alice**: And they all work together in every single turn.

**John**: Every single turn. Now, before we go, here's my challenge for you: Next time you're on the mountain, pick just one fundamental to focus on. Maybe it's that precise ankle flex at turn initiation. Maybe it's that timely compression at the fall line. Maybe it's keeping your upper body quiet while your legs steer.

**Alice**: Just one?

**John**: Just one. Because when you master one fundamental, it creates a ripple effect. The others start to improve naturally.

**Alice**: I think I'm going to focus on fundamental number five—that compression timing. I want to feel like a suspension system, not a rigid board.

**John**: Perfect choice. Alright everyone, we hope this breakdown of the five fundamentals gives you a clear operational manual for your skiing. These aren't abstract concepts—they're specific, repeatable movements you can practice and refine.

**Alice**: And remember, you're not just surviving the mountain. You're mastering the mechanics.

**John**: Beautifully said. Until next time, keep exploring!

**Alice**: Happy skiing!
