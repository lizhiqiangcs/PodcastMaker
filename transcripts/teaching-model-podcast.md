## Introduction

**John**: Welcome back to Ski Mastery Podcast! I'm John, and Alice is here with me. Today we're switching gears a bit. We've talked a lot about what to teach—the skills, the fundamentals, the movement analysis. But today we're talking about how to teach.

**Alice**: Oh, this is interesting! So it's less about the skiing itself and more about the teaching process?

**John**: Exactly! Because here's the thing: you can have perfect technical knowledge of skiing, but if you don't understand how people learn, your teaching falls flat. It's like having a beautiful recipe but not knowing how to use an oven.

**Alice**: So we're learning about the oven, not the recipe.

**John**: Perfect analogy! Today we're diving into what we call the Teaching Model—a framework that helps instructors understand the students standing in front of them, not just the skiing they're trying to teach.

**Alice**: And I'm guessing this applies whether you're teaching kids or adults?

**John**: Absolutely. Though we'll talk about some specific considerations for different ages and developmental stages. The core principle is this: effective teaching starts with understanding the learner.

**Alice**: I'm ready. Where do we start?

---

## The CAP Model: Three Dimensions of Development

**John**: Let's start with a framework called the CAP Model. This is especially powerful when teaching children, though it applies to adults too. CAP stands for three aspects of human development we need to consider: Cognitive, Affective, and Psycho-motor.

**Alice**: CAP. That's catchy. Break it down for me.

**John**: Alright. The C stands for Cognitive—how someone thinks and processes information. The A stands for Affective—how someone develops values, beliefs, and emotional responses. And the P stands for Psycho-motor—the stages of physical growth and coordination.

**Alice**: So it's mind, heart, and body?

**John**: That's a beautiful way to put it! Mind, heart, and body. And here's the key: people develop at different rates in these three areas, especially children.

**Alice**: So a kid might be physically advanced but emotionally younger, or vice versa?

**John**: Exactly! Let me give you a concrete example.

### Cognitive Development

**John**: Let's start with cognitive development. This is about how someone thinks, reasons, and processes abstract concepts. A four-year-old thinks very concretely—they live in the immediate moment. They can't really grasp abstract concepts like "balance over your outside ski throughout the arc."

**Alice**: So what do you do instead?

**John**: You make it concrete and immediate. Instead of talking about arcs and balance, you play a game: "Can you lift your inside ski off the snow like a flamingo?" The child isn't thinking about pressure distribution—they're just playing flamingo. But the result is the same.

**Alice**: So you're sneaking in the technique through play!

**John**: Exactly! Now, a ten-year-old has more developed cognitive abilities. They can start to understand simple cause-and-effect: "When you push your shin into your boot, your ski turns easier." They're not ready for biomechanics lectures, but they can grasp basic relationships.

**Alice**: And adults?

**John**: Adults can handle abstract thinking and complex explanations—if they want them. Some adults love the technical details. Others just want to ski and don't care about the mechanics. That's where you have to read the individual.

### Affective Development

**Alice**: OK, so that's the cognitive side—how they think. What about affective—the heart side?

**John**: Affective development is about emotions, values, and social awareness. Here's a classic example: a five-year-old might be terrified of being separated from their parent, even if they're having fun skiing.

**Alice**: So you can't just whisk them away to the magic carpet?

**John**: Right! You need to honor that emotional need for security. Maybe the parent skis nearby for the first few runs. As the child builds trust with you, they become comfortable with more independence.

**Alice**: So you're managing the emotional landscape, not just the skiing.

**John**: Exactly! Here's another one: a twelve-year-old might be deeply concerned about looking cool in front of peers. If you ask them to do a drill that looks silly—like exaggerated movements or a funny stance—they might shut down.

**Alice**: Because socially, looking silly is devastating at that age!

**John**: Exactly. So you frame it differently. Instead of "Do this goofy drill," you say, "This is what World Cup racers practice." Now it's cool because it's elite.

**Alice**: You're speaking their emotional language!

**John**: Exactly. And with adults, affective considerations are huge. Many adults have deep-seated fears—of falling, of looking incompetent, of being judged. You have to create emotional safety before technical learning can happen.

### Psycho-motor Development

**Alice**: OK, last one—psycho-motor. That's the body, right?

**John**: Right! This is about physical growth, coordination, and body awareness. A three-year-old has a completely different center of gravity than a ten-year-old—their head is proportionally huge, and they're top-heavy!

**Alice**: So their balance is fundamentally different!

**John**: Exactly. You can't teach a three-year-old the same way you teach a ten-year-old because their bodies work differently. The three-year-old needs activities that accommodate their proportions and coordination level.

**Alice**: Like what?

**John**: Lots of straight running, gentle terrain, simple stopping. You're not asking them to carve parallel turns. You're just building basic coordination: can they slide on two planks without falling over constantly?

**Alice**: So you're matching the task to their physical capabilities.

**John**: Exactly! And here's another example: a six-year-old might have great ideas cognitively about what to do, but their fine motor control and coordination can't execute it yet. They get frustrated because their body won't do what their brain wants.

**Alice**: So you have to calibrate expectations to their physical development, not just their mental understanding.

**John**: Perfect! That's the whole point of the CAP Model. You're looking at the whole person—how they think, how they feel, and what their body can actually do. All three have to align for effective learning.

**Alice**: So it's like a three-legged stool again—you need all three legs!

**John**: Exactly! And if you ignore any one of these dimensions, your teaching will miss the mark.

## Maslow's Hierarchy: Meeting Basic Needs First

**John**: Alright, now let's zoom out even bigger. Before any learning can happen—before we even get to CAP considerations—we have to make sure the student's basic needs are met.

**Alice**: Basic needs? Like what?

**John**: This is where Maslow's Hierarchy comes in. Abraham Maslow was a psychologist who identified that human needs exist in a hierarchy—some needs are more fundamental than others, and you can't move to higher-level needs until the basic ones are satisfied.

**Alice**: So it's like a pyramid?

**John**: Exactly! It's often shown as a pyramid. At the bottom are physiological needs—food, warmth, physical comfort. You can't learn to ski if you're freezing cold or starving hungry.

**Alice**: That makes total sense! I can't focus on anything if I'm shivering.

**John**: Right! Let me give you a concrete example. You're teaching a lesson, and you have a six-year-old student. It's 20 degrees out, and the kid's fingers are numb. Are they going to learn anything about edging technique?

**Alice**: No way! They're just suffering!

**John**: Exactly. So what do you do?

**Alice**: Take a break, warm up inside?

**John**: Perfect! You meet the physiological need first. Warm hands, maybe a hot chocolate, and then—and only then—can learning resume. The need for warmth is more fundamental than the need to learn skiing.

**Alice**: So Maslow is saying there's a pecking order to needs.

**John**: Exactly! Let me walk you through the hierarchy from bottom to top.

### The Five Levels

**John**: Level one at the base: physiological needs. Food, warmth, water, rest. If any of these are unmet, learning stops.

**Alice**: Got it. What's level two?

**John**: Level two: safety needs. This is both physical safety and emotional security. A student who feels unsafe—maybe they're terrified they're going to get hurt, or they don't trust their instructor—can't learn effectively.

**Alice**: So you have to create a safe environment first.

**John**: Exactly! This might mean starting on gentler terrain than you think they need, just to build that sense of security. Or it might mean spending the first five minutes just chatting and building rapport so they trust you emotionally.

**Alice**: So safety is physical and emotional?

**John**: Exactly. Level three: belonging and social needs. People need to feel accepted and connected. This is huge for kids in group lessons—if they feel excluded or judged by the other kids, learning shuts down.

**Alice**: So you have to foster that group cohesion.

**John**: Right! Maybe you do an icebreaker activity, or you create opportunities for the kids to support each other. You're building a sense of "we're in this together."

**Alice**: And for adults?

**John**: Same thing! Adults in group lessons need to feel like they fit in, that they're not the weakest link, that everyone is supportive. If someone feels judged or out of place, they'll mentally check out.

**Alice**: OK, so we've got physiological, safety, and belonging. What's next?

**John**: Level four: esteem needs. This is about feeling competent, respected, and valued. People need to experience success and recognition.

**Alice**: So if a student feels like a failure the whole lesson, they're not going to learn?

**John**: Exactly! This is why we structure lessons to include achievable wins. Maybe the student can't do parallel turns yet, but they can absolutely nail a clean wedge stop. You celebrate that success, build their esteem, and then they have the confidence to tackle the next challenge.

**Alice**: So you're scaffolding their confidence with small victories.

**John**: Perfect! And the fifth level, at the top of the pyramid: self-actualization. This is about personal growth, creativity, and achieving one's potential. This is where deep learning and mastery happen.

**Alice**: But you can only get there if all the other needs are met first?

**John**: Exactly! If someone is cold, scared, feeling excluded, and beaten down, they can't access that self-actualization level where real growth happens. But if you've met all those foundational needs—they're warm, safe, included, confident—then they're ready to truly learn and grow.

### Practical Applications

**Alice**: OK, so how do I use this in a real lesson?

**John**: Great question. Let's say you have a student who's struggling. Before you dive into technical corrections, you ask yourself: which level of the hierarchy is unmet?

**Alice**: Give me an example.

**John**: Sure. You're teaching an adult beginner, and they're just not progressing. They seem checked out. Before you assume they're a bad student, you investigate.

You ask: Are they warm enough? (Physiological) Have they eaten? Are they exhausted? If they're physically uncomfortable, stop and address it.

Next: Do they feel safe? (Safety) Maybe they're terrified of the slope. You need to move to easier terrain or spend time building their confidence.

Next: Do they feel comfortable with you and the group? (Belonging) Maybe they're embarrassed to be the slowest one. You need to create more social ease.

Next: Have they experienced any success? (Esteem) Maybe everything feels like failure. You need to engineer a win—even a small one.

**Alice**: So you're troubleshooting the hierarchy, not just the skiing technique!

**John**: Exactly! And here's the beautiful thing: once you identify and address the unmet need, learning often unlocks automatically. You didn't even have to change your technical teaching—you just removed the barrier.

**Alice**: That's so powerful!

**John**: It really is. Maslow's Hierarchy reminds us that humans are complex beings with layered needs. We're not just teaching skiing—we're working with whole people.

## Learning Preferences: VAK Model

**John**: Alright, now we're getting into the nuts and bolts of how people process information. This is the VAK Model: Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic learning styles.

**Alice**: VAK. Another good acronym! So people learn in different ways?

**John**: Exactly! Some people learn best through seeing, some through hearing, some through doing and feeling. And here's the thing: skiing is a complex, full-body sport, so we actually need all three styles working together.

**Alice**: So it's not like someone is only visual or only kinesthetic?

**John**: Right! Everyone uses all three modes, but individuals often have preferences or strengths. The key as an instructor is to create multi-sensory lessons that engage all three pathways. That way, you're reaching every student, regardless of their preference.

**Alice**: So you're covering all your bases.

**John**: Exactly! Let me break down each learning style.

### Visual Learners

**John**: Visual learners receive and store information best through images, demonstrations, and visual input. When you show them something, they immediately get it. When you just talk about it, it's foggy.

**Alice**: So these are the people who need to see it to believe it?

**John**: Exactly! For visual learners, your demonstration is everything. You ski down the hill showing the technique, and they're absorbing every detail—your stance, your ski position, the shape of your turns.

**Alice**: So what do you emphasize with visual learners?

**John**: Crystal-clear demonstrations. You show them the movement from multiple angles if possible. You might even draw in the snow—"Here's the path your ski will take"—creating a visual map.

**Alice**: So pictures and images trump words.

**John**: For visual learners, absolutely! But here's the thing: even if someone isn't primarily a visual learner, demonstrations still help. So you always include strong visual elements.

### Auditory Learners

**Alice**: OK, so visual is seeing. What about auditory?

**John**: Auditory learners process information verbally and cognitively. They love explanations, discussions, and talking through their experience. When you describe something in detail, they light up.

**Alice**: So these are the people who want the lecture before the demo?

**John**: Exactly! They want to understand the "why" and the "how" conceptually before they try it. And after they try it, they want to talk about what happened.

**Alice**: So you're engaging them in conversation, not just instruction.

**John**: Exactly! With auditory learners, you might ask questions like, "What did you feel in that turn? How was that different from the last run?" You're creating a dialogue, not a monologue. They process their experience through language.

**Alice**: So discussions and explanations are key.

**John**: Right! And here's the thing: even if someone isn't primarily auditory, clear explanations still help. So you always include verbal elements—you explain the "why" behind the "what."

### Kinesthetic Learners

**Alice**: And kinesthetic is about movement and feeling?

**John**: Exactly! Kinesthetic learners process information through sensations, feelings, and physical experience. They need to do it to understand it. You can show them and tell them all day, but until they feel it in their body, it doesn't click.

**Alice**: So these are the "just let me try it" people?

**John**: Exactly! They're often impatient with long explanations or demonstrations. They want to get on the hill and experiment. And their learning happens through sensory feedback—"Oh, I felt my weight shift there!" or "I felt the ski grab the snow differently."

**Alice**: So you get them moving quickly and then help them interpret what they're feeling.

**John**: Perfect! With kinesthetic learners, you might say, "As you go through this turn, notice where you feel pressure in your feet. Does it shift from your heel to your toe? From outside edge to inside edge?" You're directing their attention to the sensations.

**Alice**: So you're making the feeling conscious.

**John**: Exactly! And again, even if someone isn't primarily kinesthetic, physical practice is still essential. Skiing is a motor skill—everyone needs to feel it.

### Creating Multi-Sensory Lessons

**Alice**: So the goal is to blend all three—visual, auditory, kinesthetic—in every lesson?

**John**: Exactly! That's what makes a lesson rich and effective. Let me show you how this works with a concrete example.

## Practical Application: VAK in Action

**John**: Let's walk through two real progressions and see how we weave in all three learning styles. First one: teaching leg rotation to novice skiers to enhance balance while turning.

**Alice**: OK, I'm listening.

### Progression 1: Leg Rotation for Novices

**John**: Step one: Start without skis. Have the students twist their legs back and forth, showing them how the legs and feet rotate while the upper body and pelvis stay quiet.

**Alice**: So you're demonstrating it—that's visual.

**John**: Exactly! Then you have them try it themselves and feel the muscles working in their legs. That's kinesthetic—they're experiencing the sensation.

**Alice**: And auditory?

**John**: You lead a brief discussion: "Why do you think leg rotation is important in controlling our turns?" They talk it through, connecting the movement to the outcome. That's engaging the auditory pathway.

**Alice**: So in one simple drill, you've hit all three styles!

**John**: Exactly! Step two: Put skis on. Have them traverse or run straight, and show them how to rotate the uphill ski back and forth—pointing it one direction, then the other. You demonstrate—visual.

**Alice**: And kinesthetic?

**John**: You ask, "Can you feel your leg controlling where the ski points?" You're directing their attention to the sensation.

**Alice**: Brilliant. What's step three?

**John**: Step three: Have them repeat the rotation exercise three times, and on the third rotation uphill, they turn both skis to a stop. Then discuss: how does this leg rotation help you turn? That's auditory—they're verbalizing their understanding.

**Alice**: So you're constantly cycling through visual, kinesthetic, and auditory.

**John**: Exactly! And step four: Have them practice wedge turns while following you. You ask: "Can you feel the same muscles working?" (Kinesthetic) "Can you see the movements in my skiing?" (Visual) "How do you adapt the leg turning for different-sized turns?" (Auditory)

**Alice**: So by the end of the progression, you've engaged every learning pathway multiple times!

**John**: Exactly! And that's what makes it stick. You're not just hoping you hit their preferred learning style—you're systematically engaging all of them.

### Progression 2: Directing Pressure to Outside Ski

**Alice**: Give me another example.

**John**: Sure! Progression for directing pressure toward the outside ski for novices. Step one: Describe which ski is the outside ski and how it changes from turn to turn. Maybe draw it in the snow or demonstrate with your body. You're using auditory and visual.

**Alice**: So they see it and hear the explanation.

**John**: Exactly. Step two: While standing still, ask them to lift one ski and balance on the other. Have them try both feet, and have them observe each other. Can they identify how they're aligning their body to stay balanced?

**Alice**: So kinesthetic—they're feeling balance—and visual—they're watching each other.

**John**: Perfect! Step three: Demonstrate and have them make linked turns where they lift the outside ski a couple inches during the completion phase. Both skis are on snow during initiation and shaping. You demonstrate—visual—and they feel the balance shift—kinesthetic.

**Alice**: And then you discuss?

**John**: Exactly. You have them reflect on their experience—what worked, what didn't. That's auditory.

**Alice**: And step four?

**John**: Step four: As they get better, focus on turning while the ski is off the snow. Some students will lift the ski but stop turning—they separate the two actions. You demonstrate and explain the difference. Then they reflect on their own performance to build self-awareness. You're hitting all three styles again—visual demo, auditory explanation and discussion, kinesthetic experience.

**Alice**: I'm seeing the pattern. It's not just "show them" or "tell them" or "let them try." It's show AND tell AND try, all woven together.

**John**: Exactly! That's the power of multi-sensory teaching.

### The Teaching Cycle Within Progressions

**Alice**: I noticed something else in those progressions. You're constantly looping: they get an idea, they try it, they reflect, they adjust, they try again.

**John**: You nailed it! That's the Teaching Cycle embedded within the progression. They form an idea (often through visual and auditory input), they try it out (kinesthetic), they reflect on the result (auditory and cognitive), and they decide what to modify for the next attempt.

**Alice**: So you're creating this ongoing cycle of learning.

**John**: Exactly! And by presenting information through both showing and telling—visual demonstrations paired with verbal explanations—you're giving them a rich, complete picture of what they're trying to accomplish.

**Alice**: So they're not just guessing what success looks like.

**John**: Right! They have multiple reference points. They saw you do it, they heard you explain it, and now they're feeling it in their own body. All three channels reinforce each other.

## Putting It All Together

**John**: Alright Alice, let's bring this full circle. We've talked about three major frameworks: CAP, Maslow's Hierarchy, and VAK. How do they all work together?

**Alice**: OK, let me try to synthesize this. First, I assess where my student is developmentally using CAP—how they think, how they feel, and what their body can do.

**John**: Perfect start.

**Alice**: Then I make sure their basic needs are met using Maslow—are they warm, safe, comfortable, confident? If not, I address that first before any technical teaching.

**John**: Exactly!

**Alice**: And then, when I'm actually teaching technique, I use VAK to make sure I'm engaging all learning pathways—I show them, I tell them, and I let them feel it.

**John**: That's a perfect synthesis! You've just described effective, holistic teaching. You're considering the whole person—their developmental stage, their human needs, and their learning preferences.

**Alice**: So it's not just about skiing knowledge. It's about human knowledge.

**John**: Beautifully said! Let me give you a complete scenario that weaves all three frameworks together.

### Complete Scenario: Teaching a Six-Year-Old

**John**: You're teaching a six-year-old child. Let's walk through how you'd use all three frameworks.

**Alice**: OK, I'm listening.

**John**: First, CAP assessment. Cognitively, a six-year-old thinks concretely and lives in the present moment. They can't grasp abstract concepts yet. Affectively, they might still need parental proximity for security, and they respond well to play and imagination. Psycho-motor, they're still developing coordination and have a higher center of gravity than adults.

**Alice**: So I know I need concrete, playful activities, emotional security, and tasks that match their coordination level.

**John**: Perfect! Now, Maslow's Hierarchy. It's cold outside—physiological needs. You make sure they have proper gloves, warm layers, and you schedule a hot chocolate break mid-lesson.

**Alice**: Meeting the basic need first.

**John**: Right! Safety needs: You choose gentle terrain where they won't feel scared. You build rapport—maybe learn about their favorite cartoon character—so they trust you emotionally.

**Alice**: Creating psychological safety.

**John**: Exactly! Belonging needs: If it's a group lesson, you do a fun icebreaker so the kids feel connected. Maybe they all pretend to be penguins waddling to the lift.

**Alice**: Building that group cohesion.

**John**: Right! And esteem needs: You celebrate every small success. "Wow, you stopped all by yourself! That was amazing!" You're building their confidence with genuine praise.

**Alice**: So now they're warm, safe, connected, and feeling capable.

**John**: Perfect! Now they're ready to learn. You use VAK to teach them to stop. You show them a "pizza" wedge shape—visual. You talk about making their skis into a piece of pizza—auditory, using language they understand. And you have them slide down a gentle slope and feel the skis slow down when they make the pizza shape—kinesthetic.

**Alice**: So you've considered their developmental stage with CAP, met their needs with Maslow, and engaged all learning styles with VAK!

**John**: Perfect! That's integrated, effective teaching. You're not just throwing technique at them—you're meeting them where they are as a whole person.

## Common Teaching Mistakes

**John**: Before we wrap up, let's talk about common mistakes instructors make when they ignore these frameworks.

**Alice**: Oh, I like this. What should I avoid?

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Developmental Stage

**John**: Mistake number one: teaching over or under someone's developmental level. This happens when instructors use the same approach for everyone.

**Alice**: Like talking to a five-year-old like they're an adult?

**John**: Exactly! Or the reverse—being overly simplistic with an advanced adult who wants technical depth. You have to calibrate to the individual's CAP stage.

**Alice**: So read the person in front of you, not just the lesson plan.

**John**: Exactly!

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Unmet Needs

**John**: Mistake number two: trying to teach when basic needs aren't met. The student is cold, or scared, or feeling judged, and the instructor just pushes forward with technique.

**Alice**: So the teaching falls on deaf ears because the foundation isn't there.

**John**: Exactly! Remember Maslow: you can't build higher-level learning on an unstable foundation. If someone is freezing or terrified, stop and address that first.

**Alice**: Pause and meet the need.

**John**: Right!

### Mistake 3: Using Only One Learning Style

**John**: Mistake number three: relying on only one learning style. Maybe the instructor is naturally verbal, so they explain everything in great detail but never demonstrate or let the student practice.

**Alice**: So they're only hitting auditory learners.

**John**: Exactly! Or the opposite—an instructor who just says "follow me" and skis off without any explanation or discussion. They're only hitting visual and kinesthetic learners.

**Alice**: So you're excluding a third of the students each time!

**John**: Exactly! The fix is simple: always include visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements. Show, tell, and let them feel.

**Alice**: Cover all three pathways.

**John**: Every time!

---

## Closing Thoughts

**John**: Alright Alice, let's wrap this up. We've covered three powerful frameworks: CAP for understanding developmental stages, Maslow's Hierarchy for meeting human needs, and VAK for engaging all learning styles.

**Alice**: And the big takeaway is: effective teaching isn't just about skiing knowledge—it's about understanding people.

**John**: Perfect! You can have encyclopedic skiing knowledge, but if you don't understand how people learn, develop, and process information, your teaching will miss the mark.

**Alice**: So these frameworks turn you from a skiing expert into a teaching expert.

**John**: Exactly! And here's the beautiful thing: these frameworks aren't complicated formulas. They're just systematic ways of paying attention to the whole person in front of you.

**Alice**: CAP asks: How does this person think, feel, and move?

**John**: Right!

**Alice**: Maslow asks: Are this person's basic needs met?

**John**: Exactly!

**Alice**: And VAK asks: Am I engaging all the ways this person learns?

**John**: Perfect synthesis! Now, here's my challenge for you: Next time you're teaching—whether it's skiing or anything else—pause and ask yourself these three questions. First, what's this person's developmental stage? Second, are their basic needs met? Third, am I showing, telling, and letting them feel?

**Alice**: So I'm diagnosing the learner, not just the learning.

**John**: Beautifully said! Because at the end of the day, we're not teaching skiing—we're teaching people to ski. And that distinction changes everything.

**Alice**: People first, technique second.

**John**: Exactly! Alright everyone, we hope this framework helps you become not just a better skier, but a better teacher, coach, or mentor—on the mountain and beyond.

**Alice**: Remember: understand the person, meet their needs, engage all their senses.

**John**: Until next time, keep learning!

**Alice**: Happy teaching!
