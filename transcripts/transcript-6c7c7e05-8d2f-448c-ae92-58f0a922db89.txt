Speaker 2: Welcome back to the Deep Dive. If you're passionate about skiing but you feel like you're still just, you know, relying on sheer willpower to get down the mountain, this one's for you. Our mission today is to give you the real operational manual for ideal ski performance. We're moving past just surviving the run to actually mastering the physics of it. 

Speaker 3: Yeah, this is where you go from just being a recreational skier to an expert thinker on skis. 

Speaker 2: A thinker. I like that. 

Speaker 3: Because what we're covering isn't just like theory from a textbook, it's a system for actively managing the incredible forces the snow is putting on you. 

Speaker 2: Though you're not fighting the mountain. 

Speaker 3: You should never be fighting the mountain. You should be turning those enormous forces, the pressure, the G forces, into assets. They should be what drives your next perfect turn. 

Speaker 2: OK, so let's establish the foundation that everything we're going to talk about today rolls up into three pillars. I guess you'd call. 

Speaker 3: Them the skills concept pillars, yeah. 

Speaker 2: Pressure control, rotational control, and edging control. We're going to really unpack the precise movements for each one. 

Speaker 3: And at the heart of all three, and this is key, is one single concept, the relationship between your center of the mass, your CM, and your base of support. 

Speaker 2: Which is just your skis. 

Speaker 3: Just your skis expert. Skiing is basically a continuous act of moving your base of support underneath your CM to manage all those forces. Get that interaction wrong, even for a moment, and you lose control. 

Speaker 2: That makes so much sense. So it's not just about staying upright, it's about using the skis as this dynamic platform under your core. 

Speaker 3: Exactly. 

Speaker 2: OK, so let's start with that foundation pressure control. When we turn, the snow is literally pushing back on the skis, which pushes back on us. 

Speaker 3: Right. And you have to control that pressure in three different ways. 

Speaker 2: 3 dimensions along the length of the ski. 

Speaker 3: Four and aft. 

Speaker 2: Yeah, from 1 ski to the other and then just the overall strength of that force. 

Speaker 3: The magnitude, yeah. Yeah. So let's get into the nitty gritty of that first one. Four aft pressure control. This is the secret to staying in the sweet spot of the ski. 

Speaker 2: And not getting thrown forward or stuck in the backseat. 

Speaker 3: Exactly. And it all comes down to this incredibly precise orchestration of your three major joints, ankles, knees and hips. And you know, it gets interesting because they sometimes work in opposition. 

Speaker 2: OK, let's break that down because this is where the subtlety is. What's the ankles job here? How does it move pressure forward and back? 

Speaker 3: The ankle is the simplest lever. If you actively flex just your ankle, think about pushing your shin into the front of the boot. You immediately move your CM forward, pressure goes to the tips of the skis, and if you straighten or relax that ankle pressure moves aft toward the tail. 

Speaker 2: OK, simple enough. But then there's the knee. I feel like when I bend my knees, I'm moving forward. But the mechanics, that's not right, is it? 

Speaker 3: It's the paradox most skiers fight bending only the knee. Like imagine your heel coming up towards your glute that actually moves your pressure aft and straightening just the knee moves the pressure forward. 

Speaker 2: Wait a second. So if I flex my ankle hard and I straighten my knee a little, both of those things are pushing my weight forward. 

Speaker 3: Exactly. You're combining 2 movements to drive that CM forward along the ski. That is absolutely critical for starting a strong turn. 

Speaker 2: And the hips, how do they play into this? 

Speaker 3: The hips are a huge lever for balance. If you hinge at the hip sockets, you know, like you're bowing, pressure moves forward decisively. If you extend your hips like you're standing up really tall, pressure zips to the back. 

Speaker 2: So when I'm on a steep run and I get into that classic backseat feeling where I'm sitting back on the tails, totally out of control, what's happening there? Is it me flexing my knees too much and extending my hips pushing my CM way back? 

Speaker 3: That is the classic backseat failure. Precisely. You've extended your hips, you've over flexed your knees and you're locked. The pressure is all on the tails. You can't steer the front of the ski anymore. 

Speaker 2: Yeah, the fix is. 

Speaker 3: To fix it, you have to actively increase ankle flexion and hinge at the hips to pull that CM back over the sweet spot you see. It's an orchestra of those three joints. 

Speaker 2: A full orchestra. OK, let's pivot to the second part of pressure control, managing the overall magnitude of that pressure. How do we stop the forces from overwhelming us? 

Speaker 3: So a great analogy for this is to imagine you're on a trampoline, bouncing softly, but you're trying not to get launched into the air. You wouldn't just stand there stiff as a board, you'd constantly be flexing and extending your knees, your hips, a little at the spine. 

Speaker 2: So you're absorbing the force. These little up and down movements are actually working against the force the snow is pushing back with. 

Speaker 3: Precisely. You're absorbing the peaks of that force by flexing, and then you extend to generate new force when you need it. That's how you keep the skis working in the snow. It stops that jittery, out of control feeling you get when you try to muscle a turn by being too rigid. 

Speaker 2: That's a huge distinction. Absorbing versus just resisting. OK, final piece of pressure control, directing pressure from ski to ski, getting it all onto that outside ski. 

Speaker 3: Yes, super important for carving. This needs 2 coordinated movements. First your legs. As you go into a turn, the inside legs, knee and hip have to flex more than the outside leg. 

Speaker 2: So the inside leg gets shorter faster. 

Speaker 3: It gets shorter faster, but, and this is critical, both of your ankles have to stay equally flexed, otherwise your four aft balance goes out the window. That is, symmetry is what starts driving pressure outward. 

Speaker 2: OK so I'm shortening the inside leg to tilt and shift my weight but my whole body wants to lean into the turn. Then how do I stay balanced and keep pressure on that outside ski? 

Speaker 3: Ah, that's where the second sort of counterintuitive movement comes in your upper body, so your pelvis and your torso has to face and tilt towards the outside. Ski downhill. 

Speaker 2: Wait hold on, I always thought you lean your chest into the turn to start it. Why would you tilt towards the outside ski that feels like you're tilting? 

Speaker 3: Uphill, because your legs are already tipping into the turn. If your upper body just followed them, you'd collapse inside and lose that outside edge completely. By tilting your upper body out and downhill, you create a counterbalance. You create angulation and that stabilizes your CM and make sure the maximum pressure stays on that outside ski so it can carve cleanly. 

Speaker 2: That perfectly sets up our next skill. Let's move to that second pillar, rotational control. So we've got the pressure managed. Now we need to point the skis. This is about separation, right? Yeah. 

Speaker 3: And separation is a great word for it. What you're separating is the rotation of your lower body from the stabilizing role of your upper body. The ideal is leg rotation. 

Speaker 2: Meaning the legs are moving independently inside the hip socket. 

Speaker 3: Exactly. They control the direction of the skis. 

Speaker 2: And why is that so much better than just twisting your whole body into the turn? 

Speaker 3: It all comes down to precision. When you steer with your legs, you control everything. The duration, the amount, the rate, the speed of the turn with like surgical precision. And you can control each ski independently, which is huge for adapting to terrain. 

Speaker 2: I remember trying to learn by throwing my shoulders downhill, thinking to my shoulders go. The skis will follow. 

Speaker 3: A classic pitfall. 

Speaker 2: I just fought myself down the entire run. 

Speaker 3: That's upper body rotation. When you lead with your torso, your shoulders, your head, the legs are just sort of passively following along. It's almost impossible to control the outcome. You get this really abrupt start to the turn that's hard to stop. 

Speaker 2: And the inside ski starts turning first. 

Speaker 3: Often, yes, which just destroys the pressure application we were just talking about. 

Speaker 2: So the legs are the engine for turning and the upper body stays quiet, providing that counterbalance. 

Speaker 3: Exactly. Keep the core calm, let the legs do the work. 

Speaker 2: Which brings us beautifully to our third pillar edging control. We have pressure, we have direction. Now we need to control the angle of the ski on a snow so we can grip. This is about inclination versus angulation. 

Speaker 3: Right inclination is the basic move. It's just moving your center of mass to the inside of the term. Just like leaning a bike into a corner. You have to do it to balance against the lateral forces, and when it's done right, the whole body inclines together from your feet all the way up to your head. 

Speaker 2: But just leaning seems risky. If I only lean my body I feel like I'd either fall over or I wouldn't get enough edge angle to really carve. 

Speaker 3: You hit the nail on the head. Pure inclination is almost never enough, not at speed or on hard snow. That's why angulation is its essential partner. 

Speaker 2: OK, so define angulation again. For us, it's creating angles between body parts, right? 

Speaker 3: We use two main types. First is knee angulation. This is where your lower leg tips in more than your upper leg, creating a little angle at the knee. It's subtle, but it drives the edge angle up without you having to lean your whole body over. 

Speaker 2: And the second time. 

Speaker 3: Hip angulation. This is where the legs are tipped way more than the upper body, making a really clear angle at your Hick socket. You see this in high performance carving, whereas skiers legs are almost flat on the snow, but their torso is still pretty centered. 

Speaker 2: I see, so you're maximizing the edge angle while keeping the CM stable over the skis? This all seems so integrated. Do we use one more than the other? 

Speaker 3: Well, it's a continuum. Knee angulation is great for quick subtle edge changes. Medium turns Hip angulation is what you need for those really high speed, powerful high edge angle turns. But the real art is combining them, tipping the feet, flexing the knees and hips, using leg rotation all together to dial in the exact edge angle you need. 

Speaker 2: That's the difference between just turning and truly carving. 

Speaker 3: Absolutely. You can't separate the pillars, you can't control your edge without managing pressure, and you can't manage pressure without steering rotationally. 

Speaker 2: So to bring this all together, our sources distill these three pillars down into the five fundamentals. These are the key actions for ideal performance. 

Speaker 3: And we can connect them right back to that CMBOS relationship. 

Speaker 2: OK, let's do a quick review for four aft pressure, the fundamental is. 

Speaker 3: Control the relationship of the center of mass to the base of support to direct pressure along the length of the skis. That's your ankle, knee, hip orchestra. Got it. 

Speaker 2: For ski to ski pressure. 

Speaker 3: It's there control pressure from ski to ski and direct pressure toward the outside ski. That's your asymmetrical leg flexion and upper body counter tilt. 

Speaker 2: OK, the edging skill is. 

Speaker 3: Control edge angles through a combination of inclination and angulation and steering. That's fundamental for control the skis. Rotation turning, pivoting with leg rotation separate from the upper body. 

Speaker 2: Power below the waist, right? 

Speaker 3: And the last one, number 5 is that dynamic part of pressure, regulate the magnitude of pressure created through the ski snow interaction, your trampoline movements. 

Speaker 2: So really, what this all means is that instead of letting the forces drive you, you're constantly chasing your own center of mass with your feet. You're always moving your base of support to stay under your core. 

Speaker 3: You are driving the forces, not being driven by them. And you realize that expert skiing isn't about brute strength. It's about subtle, precise, tiny adjustments in your ankles, knees, and hips to keep your CM perfectly aligned over your Bosa. 

Speaker 2: Master class in movement. OK, before we wrap up, let's leave everyone with a final thought. We know you need inclination leaning to balance against the forces of a turn. So here's the question, how do advanced skiers use that specific combination of knee and hip angulation to maintain balance and get insane edge grip without having to rely on an excessive risky amount of lean, especially when the forces are really high? 

Speaker 3: That combination, that's the next layer, the efficiency of the movement. Next time you're on the hill, watch for it. You'll never see a turn the same way again. 

Speaker 2: That's it for this deep dive into the blueprint for ideal ski performance. We'll catch you next time.
